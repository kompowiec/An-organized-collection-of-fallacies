      Gish Gallop
    </h1>
<header/>    

    <div class="content clearfix">
      <p class="Body">
        <strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;Overwhelming an interlocutor with as many arguments as possible, without regard for accuracy or strength of the arguments. This is especially disingenuous when the interlocutor is not allowed to interrupt and address the arguments, as in formal debate or in writing. To the spectator unfamiliar with this strategy, the interlocutor&#x2019;s inability to accurately respond to all the claims in the given time is fallaciously seen as a &#x201c;win&#x201d; for the Gish Galloper or appears to lend credibility to the arguments made when in fact it does not.
      </p>
      <p class="Body">
        <strong>Logical Form:</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
        Person 1 presents weak arguments A, B, C, D, E... without Person 2 being given the opportunity to address each argument.
      </p>
      <p class="Body">
        <strong>Example #1: </strong>The term was coined by Eugenie Scott of the National Center for Science Education in the 1990s. Dr. Scott coined the term based on the behavior of creationist Duane Gish in formal debates. Dr. Scott states:
      </p>
      <p class="Body" style="padding-left: 40px">
        <em>&#x201c;On the radio, I have been able to stop Gish, et al, and say, &#x2018;Wait a minute, if X is so, then wouldn't you expect Y?&#x2019; or something similar, and show that their &#x2018;model&#x2019; is faulty. But in a debate, the evolutionist has to shut up while the creationist Gallops along, spewing out nonsense with every paragraph.&#x201d;</em>
      </p>
      <p class="Body">
        <strong>Example #2:</strong>&nbsp;In a 2012 debate between Mitt Romney and President Obama, Romney overwhelmed Obama with many arguments of questionable strength, resulting in many referring to Romney&#x2019;s strategy as an example of the Gish Gallop.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p class="Body">
        <strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp;The two key characteristics of the Gish Gallop are 1) the number of arguments in uninterrupted succession and 2) the lack of strength of the arguments presented. The number of arguments presented is problematic when the interlocutor doesn&#x2019;t have a reasonable amount of time (or space if in writing and limited by characters) to respond. The strength of the arguments is debatable, so in the case of Romney and Obama, it can be argued that Romney was making strong arguments, in which case Romney&#x2019;s crime was simply presenting too many of these arguments at once.
      </p>
      <p class="Body">
        <strong>Fun Fact:</strong>&nbsp;A thousand bad arguments don&#x2019;t add up to a single good argument, although many people interpret numerous bad arguments as &#x201c;strong evidence&#x201d; (e.g., &#x201c;they can&#x2019;t all be wrong&#x201d; - Yes, they can all be wrong.)

        Argument by Fast Talking
      </h1>
      <header/>
      

      <div class="content clearfix">
        <p class="Body">
          <strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;When fast talking is seen as intelligence and/or confidence in the truth of one&#x2019;s argument; therefore, seen as evidence of the truth of the argument itself.
        </p>
        <p class="Body">
          <strong>Logical Form:</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
          According to person 1, Y is true.
        </p>
        <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
          Person 1 speaks very fast.
        </p>
        <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
          Therefore, Y is true.
        </p>
        <p class="Body">
          <strong>Example #1:</strong>&nbsp;(to be read extremely fast)
        </p>
        <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
          I hereby submit that it is crystal clear that there is only one true God, without question, without reserve, without hesitation I can say this because I know the truth and I am here to share it with you.&nbsp;&nbsp;Praise Allah!
        </p>
        <p class="Body">
          <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;There is absolutely no evidence in the above claim, and if you read it quickly and clearly, you would persuade more people than if you read it like one of the Beverly Hillbillies.&nbsp;&nbsp;If your intent was to persuade others by not giving them time to process what you have said, then you would be guilty of this fallacious tactic.
        </p>
        <p class="Body">
          <strong>Example #2:</strong>&nbsp;(same example - to be read extremely fast)
        </p>
        <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
          I hereby submit that it is crystal clear that there is only one true God, without question, without reserve, without hesitation I can say this because I know the truth and I am here to share it with you.&nbsp;&nbsp;Praise Allah!
        </p>
        <p class="Body">
          <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;This time, as the one evaluating the argument, if you allow the rapid pace of the delivery of the argument to serve as evidence for the claim, you are committing the fallacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the arguer does sound confident, and perhaps you are embarrassed to ask him to repeat the argument or slow down; therefore, you just accept it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Either way, that is fallacious reasoning.
        </p>
        <p class="Body">
          <strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp;Naturally fast talkers most likely have no intent to deceive, and if you consciously give no undue weight to the claims of a natural fast talker, then no fallacy has been committed.
        </p>
        <p class="Body">
          <strong>Tip:</strong>&nbsp;Work on your pace as a part of your speaking.&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be just slow enough where you do not lose your audience, and no slower, unless going for a dramatic effect.

      <b>Questionable cause</b>

    <p>
      (also known as: butterfly logic, ignoring a common cause, neglecting a common cause, confusing correlation and causation, confusing cause and effect, false cause, third cause, third-cause fallacy, juxtaposition [form of], reversing causality/wrong direction [form of])
    </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;Concluding that one thing caused another, simply because they are regularly associated.

    </p>
    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      A is regularly associated with B; therefore, A causes B.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">

    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      Every time I go to sleep, the sun goes down.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, my going to sleep causes the sun to set.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;I hope the fallacious reasoning here is very clear and needs no explanation.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Example #2:</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      Many homosexuals have AIDS. Therefore, homosexuality causes AIDS.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;While AIDS is found in a much larger percentage of the homosexual population than in the heterosexual population, we cannot conclude that homosexuality is the cause of AIDS, any more than we can conclude that heterosexuality is the cause of pregnancy.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp;When strong evidence is provided for causation, it is not a fallacy.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Variation:</strong>&nbsp;The <i>juxtaposition fallacy</i>&nbsp;is putting two items/ideas together, implying a causal connection, but never actually stating that one exists.
    </p>
    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      It&#x2019;s funny how whenever you are around, the room smells bad.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <i>Reversing causality</i>&nbsp;or <i>wrong direction </i>is just what is sounds like -- it is still a false cause, but the specific case where one claims something like the sun sets because night time is coming.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Fun Fact:</strong>&nbsp;To establish causality you need to show three things: 1) that X came before Y, 2) that the observed relationship between X and Y didn't happen by chance alone, and 3) that there is nothing else that accounts for the X then Y relationship.

    <p http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Description:</span>&#xa0;The cum hoc fallacy assumes that because two events occur together, they must be causally connected. It disregards the possibility of coincidence or an external factor influencing both events. This fallacy erroneously concludes causation based merely on simultaneous occurrence.
    </p>
    <p http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Logical Form:</span>
    </p>
    <p http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
      &#xa0;&#xa0;1. Event A occurs at the same time as Event B.
    </p>
    <p http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
      &#xa0;&#xa0;2. It is assumed that Event A causes Event B or vice versa.

    <p http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
      &#xa0;&#xa0;3. The possibility of coincidence or an external factor is ignored.

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Example #1:</span>
    </p>
    <p http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- Scenario: A tourist gives a Spanish peasant and his wife bananas for the first time. As the farmer bites into his, the train enters a tunnel. He shouts, &quot;Don’t eat it, Carmen! They make you blind.&quot;
    </p>
    <p http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- Explanation: The farmer assumes that the act of eating the banana caused the blindness (darkness), ignoring the coincidental timing of the train entering the tunnel.
    </p>
    <p http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Example #2:</span>
    </p>
    <p http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- Scenario: A statistician finds that neatness of handwriting in 7-12-year-old children correlates with shoe size, concluding that neat handwriting causes bigger feet.
    </p>
    <p http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- Explanation: The correlation is due to older children, who naturally have bigger feet and more developed handwriting skills, not because neat handwriting causes larger feet.
    </p>
    <p http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tip:</span>&#xa0;Always question whether a relationship between two events is genuinely causal or simply coincidental. Look for evidence of causation and consider external factors that might influence both events. Correlation does not imply causation.

    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Description:</strong>&#xa0;Claiming that because event Y followed event X, event Y must have been caused by event X, without properly establishing causality.

      <p class="Body">
        <strong>Example #1: </strong>Doug is convinced he has lucky underwear. One time when he forgot to put on his lucky underwear, he got a parking ticket. Doug concludes that because he forgot to wear his lucky underwear, he got the ticket. Doug doesn't wash his lucky underwear often. This part isn't relevant to the example, but it is disturbing nonetheless.
      </p>
      <p class="Body">
        <strong>Explanation:</strong>&#xa0;Doug is not making any attempts to determine the most probabilistic causal factors for getting the parking ticket. Instead, largely because of the <em>confirmation bias</em>, he is making a claim of causality based on the order of events (first he forgot his lucky underwear, then he got the ticket.)
      </p>
      <p class="Body">
        <strong>Example #2:&#xa0;</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="Body" style="text-align: left; padding-left: 40px">
        <em><span style="color: rgb(52, 73, 94);">Tony: I bought a book on the law of attraction and two days later I won $30k in a lottery. I wasn’t a believer of the law of attraction before, but now I am!</span></em>
      </p>
      <p class="Body">
        <strong>Explanation:</strong>&#xa0;Although Tony bought the lottery ticket prior to buying the book, he believes that the act of wanting to win badly enough caused him to win the lottery, because first came the desire, then the win. The fact is, there is no evidence that his desire had any effect on the win whatsoever. To suggest this is the case, in addition to <em>ad hoc reasoning</em>, would be <em>magical thinking</em>&#xa0;&#xa0;since there is no naturalistic mechanism that could account for his desire resulting in his win.
      </p>
      <p class="Body">
        <strong>Exception:</strong>&#xa0;If one claims that Y caused X by adding additional details that properly establish causality, this fallacy would not apply.
      </p>
      <p class="Body">
        <strong>Fun Fact:</strong>&#xa0;There is some non-mystical truth to the law of attraction. That which you obsess over you are more likely to adjust your behaviors in a way that will help make your obsession a reality. For example, if you want to graduate college more than anything, you will most likely study harder, ask for extra help, and blow off fewer classes. No magic required.

    <strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;Reasoning that, in a situation that is pure random chance, the outcome can be affected by previous outcomes.

    <p class="Body" style="padding-left: 40px">
      <font color="rgb(52, 73, 94)"><em>Situation X is purely random.</em></font><br><font color="rgb(52, 73, 94)"><em>Situation X resulted in Y.</em></font><br><font color="rgb(52, 73, 94)"><em>Y is less likely to be the result next time.</em></font>
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Example #1:</strong>
    </p>
    <p style="padding-left: 40px">
      <font color="rgb(52, 73, 94)"><em>I have flipped heads five times in a row.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, the next flip will probably be tails.</em></font>
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;The odds for each and every flip are calculated independently from other flips.&nbsp;&nbsp;The chance for each flip is 50/50, no matter how many times heads came up before.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Example #2:</strong>
    </p>
    <p style="padding-left: 40px">
      <font color="rgb(52, 73, 94)"><em>Eric: For my lottery numbers, I chose 6, 14, 22, 35, 38, 40.&nbsp;&nbsp;What did you choose?</em></font>

    <p style="padding-left: 40px">
      <font color="rgb(52, 73, 94)"><em>Eric: You idiot!&nbsp;&nbsp;Those numbers will never come up!</em></font>
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;&#x201c;Common sense&#x201d; is contrary to logic and probability, when people think that any possible lottery number is more probable than any other.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is because we see meaning in patterns -- but probability doesn&#x2019;t.&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of what is called the <i>clustering illusion</i>, we give the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 special meaning when arranged in that order, random chance is just as likely to produce a 1 as the first number as it is a 6.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the second number produced is only affected by the first selection in that the first number is no longer a possible choice, but still, the number 2 has the same odds of being selected as 14, and so on.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Example #3:</strong>
    </p>
    <p style="padding-left: 40px">
      <font color="rgb(52, 73, 94)"><em>Maury: Please put all my chips on red 21.</em></font>
    </p>
    <p style="padding-left: 40px">
      <font color="rgb(52, 73, 94)"><em>Dealer: Are you sure you want to do that?&nbsp;&nbsp;Red 21 just came up in the last spin.</em></font>
    </p>
    <p style="padding-left: 40px">
      <font color="rgb(52, 73, 94)"><em>Maury:&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn&#x2019;t know that!&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you!&nbsp;&nbsp;Put it on black 15 instead.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can&#x2019;t believe I almost made that mistake!</em></font>
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;The dealer (or whatever you call the person spinning the roulette wheel) really should know better -- the fact that red 21 just came up is completely irrelevant to the chances that it will come up again for the next spin.&nbsp;&nbsp;If it did, to us, that would seem &#x201c;weird,&#x201d; but it is simply the inevitable result of probability.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp;If you think something is random, but it really isn&#x2019;t -- like a loaded die, then previous outcomes can be used as an indicator of future outcomes.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Tip:</strong>&nbsp;Gamble for fun, not for the money, and don&#x2019;t wager more than you wouldn&#x2019;t mind losing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember, at least as far as casinos go, the odds are against you.

      (also known as: hot hand phenomenon)
    </p>
  
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;The hot hand fallacy is the irrational belief that if you win or lose several chance games in a row, you are either &#x201c;hot&#x201d; or &#x201c;cold,&#x201d; respectively, meaning that the streak is likely to continue and has to do with something other than pure probability.&nbsp;&nbsp;Because we are generally stupid when it comes to realizing this, and pigheaded when it comes to accepting this fact, casinos around the world make a lot of money. This is similar to the<i>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/logicalfallacies/Gamblers-Fallacy" target="fallacy" data-toggle="tooltip" title="" data-original-title="Reasoning that, in a situation that is pure random chance, the outcome can be affected by previous outcomes.">gambler&#x2019;s fallacy</a></i>.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Logical Form:</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      Person 1 has won a probability game X times in a row.
    </p>
    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      Therefore, person 1 is &quot;hot&quot; and likely to win again the next game.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Example #1:</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      Marta: (shooting craps) Let's just cash in now. We did great, but let's quit while we're ahead.
    </p>
    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      Carlos: Forget it! We are hot! Let's see how long this streak will last!
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;Statistically, Carlos and Marta are more likely to lose the next game since a) their &quot;streak&quot; is probability-based, not talent-based and b) the odds are against them in the game of craps. Carlos is incorrectly viewing the string of wins as a streak that is more likely to continue than not.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Example #2:</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      There are examples based on events that are not purely probabilistic, such as shooting baskets in the game of basketball. These examples are controversial because although some of the success, some of the time can be attributed to probability alone, there is no question that talent and belief can affect the outcome.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Fun Fact:</strong>&nbsp;The belief that you are &quot;on fire&quot; (i.e., performing exceptionally well) can lead to better performance, via the <i>self-fulfilling prophecy</i>. There are times when thinking too critically can negatively affect performance.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp;As mentioned, a streak of favorable talent-based actions can be the result of superior physical and mental performance.&nbsp;

      (also known as: ludus)
    </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;Assuming flawless statistical models apply to situations where they actually don&#x2019;t.&nbsp;&nbsp;This can result in the over-confidence in probability theory or simply not knowing exactly where it applies as opposed to chaotic situations or situations with external influences too subtle or numerous to predict.

    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Example #1:</strong>&nbsp;The best example of this fallacy is presented by the person who coined this term, Nassim Nicholas Taleb in his 2007 book, <i>The Black Swan</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are two people:
    </p>
    <p style="padding-left: 40px">
      <font color="rgb(52, 73, 94)"><em>Dr. John, who is regarded as a man of science and logical thinking.</em></font>

    </p>
    <p style="padding-left: 40px">
      <font color="rgb(52, 73, 94)"><em>A third party asks them, &quot;assume a fair coin is flipped 99 times, and each time it comes up heads. What are the odds that the 100th flip would also come up heads?&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. John says that the odds are not affected by the previous outcomes so the odds must still be 50/50.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fat Tony says that the odds of the coin coming up heads 99 times in a row are so low (less than 1 in 6.33 &#xd7; 1029) that the initial assumption that the coin had a 50/50 chance of coming up heads is most likely incorrect.</em></font>
    </p>
    <p class="Body">

    <p>
      <strong>Fun Fact:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Chaos theory plays a huge role in our universe, and it is way beyond the scope of this book.&nbsp;&nbsp;As for this fallacy, many things that appear to be random are actually chaotic systems, or unpredictable, deterministic systems.&nbsp;&nbsp;Attempting to apply the rules of random probability in those cases will result in all kinds of errors.

      Therefore, A caused B.

      I had a real bad headache, then saw my doctor.&#xa0;&#xa0;Just by talking with him, my headache started to subside, and I was all better the next day.&#xa0;&#xa0;It was well worth the $200 visit fee.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&#xa0;Headaches are a part of life, and naturally come and go on their own with varying degrees of pain. They regress to the mean on their own, the “mean” being a normal state of no pain, with or without medical or chemical intervention. Had the person seen a gynecologist instead, the headache would have still subsided, and it would have been a much more interesting visit—especially if he were a man.
    </p>

    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      After surgery, my wife was not doing too well -- she was in a lot of pain.&#xa0;&#xa0;I bought these magnetic wristbands that align with the body's natural vibrations to reduce the pain, and sure enough, a few days later the pain subsided!&#xa0;&#xa0;Thank you magic wristbands!
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&#xa0;It is normal to be in pain after any significant surgery.&#xa0;&#xa0;It is also normal for the pain to subside as the body heals -- this is the body <i>regressing to the mean</i>.&#xa0;&#xa0;Assuming the magic wristbands caused the pain relief and ignoring the regression back to the mean, is fallacious.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Exception:</strong>&#xa0;Of course, if the “cause” is explained as the natural regression to the mean, then in a way it is not fallacious.

      My headache went away because that’s what headaches eventually do -- they are a temporary disruption in the normal function of a brain.

    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Fun Fact: </strong>Seeing a doctor can have a real effect on pain relief, even if the doctor does nothing but provide a sympathetic ear. This is known as the <em>psychosocial context of the therapeutic intervention</em>&#xa0;&#xa0;and is often considered part of the <em>placebo effect</em>.

      We cannot unlock our child from the closet because if we do, she will want to roam the house.&nbsp;&nbsp;If we let her roam the house, she will want to roam the neighborhood.&nbsp;&nbsp;If she roams the neighborhood, she will get picked up by a stranger in a van, who will sell her in a sex slavery ring in some other country.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, we should keep her locked up in the closet.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;In this example, it starts out with reasonable effects to the causes.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, yes, if the child is allowed to go free in her room, she would most likely want to roam the house -- 95% probability estimate<a title="" href="http://www.logicallyfallacious.com/index.php/logical-fallacies/163-slippery-slope#_ftn1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure, if she roams the house, she will probably want the freedom of going outside, but not necessarily &#x201c;roaming the neighborhood&#x201d;, but let&#x2019;s give that a probability of say 10%.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we start to get very improbable.&nbsp;&nbsp;The chances of her getting picked up by a stranger (.05%) in a van (35%) to sell her into sex slavery (.07%) in another country (40%) is next to nothing when you do all the math:

    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Example #1:</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="Body" style="padding-left: 40px">
      <font color="rgb(52, 73, 94)"><em>The &#x201c;prophet&#x201d; Nostradamus wrote about 500 years ago:</em></font>

    <p style="padding-left: 40px">
      <font color="rgb(52, 73, 94)"><em>Beasts wild with hunger will cross the rivers,<br>The greater part of the battle will be against Hister.<br>He will cause great men to be dragged in a cage of iron,<br>When the son of Germany obeys no law.</em></font>

    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;When you focus on just that prediction, then it might seem that way, but realize that Nostradamus made over 1000 &#x201c;predictions&#x201d;, most (all?) of which are vague nonsense.&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that many predictions, it is statistically impossible NOT to match at least one with an actual event.&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, if you ignore the noise (the predictions that do not make any sense), it looks amazing.&nbsp;&nbsp;By the way, &#x201c;Hister&#x201d; is the Latin name for the Danube River.

      <strong>Fun Fact: </strong>The name &#x201c;<em>Texas sharpshooter fallacy</em>&#x201d; comes from the idea that someone could shoot randomly at a barn, then draw a bullseye around the largest cluster, making it appear as if they were a sharpshooter.

    <p>
      (also known as: superstitious thinking)
    </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;Making causal connections or correlations between two events not based on logic or evidence, but primarily based on superstition.&nbsp;&nbsp;Magical thinking often causes one to experience <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irrational">irrational</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;fear of performing certain acts or having certain thoughts because they assume a correlation with their acts and threatening calamities.

    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Logical Form:</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="Body" style="padding-left: 40px">
      <font color="rgb(52, 73, 94)"><em>Event A occurs.</em></font><br><font color="rgb(52, 73, 94)"><em>Event B occurs.</em></font><br><font color="rgb(52, 73, 94)"><em>Because of superstition or magic, event A is causally connected to or correlated with event B.</em></font>
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Example #1:</strong>
    </p>
    <p style="padding-left: 40px">
      <font color="rgb(52, 73, 94)"><em>Mr. Governor issues a proclamation for the people of his state to pray for rain.&nbsp;&nbsp;Several months later, it rains.&nbsp;&nbsp;Praise the gods!</em></font>
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;Suggesting that appealing to the gods for rain via prayer or dance is just the kind of thing crazy enough to get you elected president of the United States, but there is absolutely no logical reason or evidence to support the claim that appealing to the gods will make it rain.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Example #2:</strong>
    </p>
    <p style="padding-left: 40px">
      <font color="rgb(52, 73, 94)"><em>I refuse to stay on the 13th floor of any hotel because it is bad luck.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I don&#x2019;t mind staying on the same floor as long as we call it the 14th floor.</em></font>
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;This demonstrates the kind of <i>magical thinking</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;that so many people engage in, that, according to Dilip Rangnekar of Otis Elevators, an estimated 85% of buildings with elevators did not have a floor numbered &#x201c;13&#x201d;.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is zero evidence that the number 13 has any property that causes bad luck -- of course, it is the superstitious mind that connects that number with bad luck.

    <p class="Body">

  <p>
    <strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;When one argues that no useful distinction can be made between two extremes, just because there is no definable moment or point on the spectrum where the two extremes meet.&nbsp;&nbsp;The name comes from the heap paradox in philosophy, using a man&#x2019;s beard as an example.&nbsp;&nbsp;At what point does a man go from clean-shaven to having a beard?

      Why does the law state that you have to be 21 years old to drink?&nbsp;&nbsp;Does it really make any difference if you are 20 years and 364 days old?&nbsp;&nbsp;That is absurd.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, if a single day makes no difference, then a collection of 1095 single days won&#x2019;t make any difference. Therefore, changing the drinking age to 18 will not make any difference.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;Although this does appear to be typical 18-year-old thinking (sorry 18 year-olds), it is quite a common fallacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just because any single step makes no <i>apparent</i>&nbsp;difference, there is a difference that becomes more noticeable as the number of those steps increase.

      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;What Willard did not take into consideration is &#x201c;baldness&#x201d; is a term used to define a state along a continuum, and although there is no clear point between bald and not bald, the extremes are both clearly recognizable and achievable.

  <p>
    <strong>Description:</strong>&#xa0;Offering a poorly supported claim about what might have happened in the past or future, if (the hypothetical part) circumstances or conditions were different.&#xa0;&#xa0;The fallacy also entails treating future hypothetical situations as if they are fact.

    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&#xa0;This is speculation at best, not founded on evidence, and is <i><a href="https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/logicalfallacies/Unfalsifiability" target="fallacy" data-toggle="tooltip" title="" data-original-title="Confidently asserting that a theory or hypothesis is true or false even though the theory or hypothesis cannot possibly be contradicted by an observation or the outcome of any physical experiment, usually without strong evidence or good reasons.">unfalsifiable</a></i>.&#xa0;&#xa0;There are many people with far more useful talents who are unemployed, and many who are “gainfully” employed who are not doing well at all.

      <b>Appeals to emotion</b>

  </span>
    <p>
      (also known as: Argumentum ad passiones, Emotional appeals, appeal to pathos, argument by vehemence, playing on emotions, emotional appeal, for the children)
    </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Description:</strong>&#xa0;This is the general category of many fallacies that use emotion in place of reason in order to attempt to win the argument.&#xa0;&#xa0;It is a type of manipulation used in place of valid logic.

    <p class="Body">
      There are several specifically emotional fallacies that I list separately in this book, because of their widespread use.&#xa0;&#xa0;However, keep in mind that you can take any emotion, precede it with, “appeal to”, and you have created a new fallacy, but by definition, the emotion must be used in place of a valid reason for supporting the conclusion.

      Power lines cause cancer.&#xa0;&#xa0;I met a little boy with cancer who lived just 20 miles from a power line who looked into my eyes and said, in his weak voice, “Please do whatever you can so that other kids won’t have to go through what I am going through.”&#xa0;&#xa0;I urge you to vote for this bill to tear down all power lines and replace them with monkeys on treadmills.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&#xa0;Notice the form of the example: assertion, emotional appeal, request for action (conclusion) -- nowhere is there any evidence presented.&#xa0;&#xa0;We can all tear up over the image of a little boy with cancer who is expressing concern for others rather than taking pity on himself, but that has nothing to do with the assertion or the conclusion.

    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&#xa0;The thought of people torturing babies for fun immediately brings up unpleasant images (in sane people).&#xa0;&#xa0;The actual argument (implied) is that there are objective (universal) rights and wrongs (morality).&#xa0;&#xa0;The argument is worded in such a way to connect the argument's conclusions (that there is objective morality) with the idea that torturing babies for fun is wrong (this is also a <i><a href="https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/logicalfallacies/Non-Sequitur" target="fallacy" data-toggle="tooltip" title="" data-original-title="When the conclusion does not follow from the premises.  In more informal reasoning, it can be when what is presented as evidence or reason is irrelevant or adds very little support to the conclusion." aria-describedby="tooltip120619">non sequitur</a>&#xa0;&#xa0;fallacy</i>).&#xa0;&#xa0;No matter how we personally feel about a horrible act, our feelings are not a valid substitution for an objective reason behind <i>why</i>&#xa0;&#xa0;the act is horrible.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Exceptions:</strong>&#xa0;Appealing to emotions is a very powerful and necessary technique in persuasion.&#xa0;&#xa0;We are emotional creatures; therefore, we often make decisions and form beliefs erroneously based on emotions, when reason and logic tell us otherwise.&#xa0;&#xa0;However, using appeals to emotion as a backup to rational and logical arguments is not only valid, but a skill possessed by virtually every great communicator.&#xa0;

    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;Timmy&#x2019;s faith is waning, but Mom, like most moms, is very good at scaring the Hell, in this case, into, Timmy.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a fallacy because Mom provided no evidence that disbelief in God will lead to an eternity of suffering in Hell, but because the possibility is terrifying to Timmy, he &#x201c;accepts&#x201d; the proposition (to believe in God), despite the lack of actual evidence.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp;When fear is not the primary motivator, but a supporting one and the probabilities of the fearful event happening are honestly disclosed, it would not be fallacious.

      <strong>Tip:</strong>&nbsp;Think in terms of probabilities, not possibilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many things are possible, including a lion busting into your home at night and mauling you to death -- but it is very, very improbable.&nbsp;&nbsp;People who use fear to manipulate you, count on you to be irrational and emotional rather than reasonable and calculating.&nbsp;&nbsp;Prove them wrong.

    <p>
      - **Name**: Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt (FUD)
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Also known as**: FUD
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Description**: FUD is a strategic tactic used to influence 
      perception by spreading negative, misleading, or uncertain information. 
      It aims to create fear, uncertainty, and doubt about a competitor or 
      product, thereby affecting decisions and behaviors.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form**: Presenting dubious or negative information with the 
      intention of undermining confidence in a product, idea, or competitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1**: A company spreads rumors about the security 
      vulnerabilities of a competitor's software to deter potential customers 
      from choosing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation**: By emphasizing the perceived risks associated with 
      the competitor’s product, the company creates fear and uncertainty, 
      making customers more likely to choose their own, supposedly safer, 
      product.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2**: An organization claims that a new technological 
      innovation might lead to job losses and economic instability without 
      solid evidence to support these claims.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation**: The organization uses these unfounded fears to create 
      doubt about the benefits of the new technology, thereby discouraging its 
      adoption and protecting their own interests.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation**: Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt, and Deception (FUDD)
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip**: To counteract FUD, focus on providing clear, factual 
      information and evidence to address and dispel the concerns raised.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception**: FUD can be legitimate if it is based on credible 
      information and genuine concerns. However, it is often used unethically 
      to manipulate perceptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact**: The term FUD was originally coined in the 1970s by IBM 
      employees to describe tactics used by IBM to discredit competitors and 
      maintain its market dominance.

    <p>
      (also known as: argumentum ad invidiam)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - **Name**: Argumentum Ad Invidiam
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Also known as**: Appeal to Envy
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Description**: Argumentum ad invidiam is a logical fallacy where an 
      argument is made by appealing to the audience's envy or resentment 
      towards the target. Rather than addressing the merits of the argument 
      itself, it seeks to undermine the target by exploiting negative emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form**: The argument suggests that the target should be 
      discredited or dismissed because of the audience's envy or negative 
      feelings towards them.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1**: &quot;You shouldn't trust his opinion on investment 
      strategies—he's just a wealthy elitist who doesn’t understand the 
      struggles of ordinary people.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation**: This statement dismisses the person's credibility 
      based on envy towards their wealth rather than addressing the actual 
      validity of their investment advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2**: &quot;Why should we listen to her arguments about 
      environmental conservation? She's just a successful celebrity who lives 
      in luxury and doesn't face the same issues we do.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation**: This example undermines the individual's arguments by 
      appealing to the audience's resentment towards the celebrity’s wealth 
      and lifestyle, rather than engaging with the content of her arguments.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation**: Ad Hominem Envy
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip**: To avoid falling into the trap of Argumentum ad Invidiam, 
      focus on evaluating the argument based on its own merits and evidence, 
      rather than the personal attributes or status of the person presenting 
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception**: It can be relevant to address the credibility of an 
      argument if the personal attributes of the speaker directly impact the 
      validity of their claims, but this should be done based on evidence, not 
      envy.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact**: The term &quot;ad invidiam&quot; comes from Latin, where &quot;invidia&quot; 
      means &quot;envy,&quot; highlighting the role of negative emotions in this fallacy.

      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;The attempt is to get you to make a decision out of fear rather than reason, thus increasing the <i>perceived</i>&nbsp;cost of not accepting Christianity as true.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many Christians who reject the idea of Hell and eternal torment by a perfectly loving God.&nbsp;&nbsp;Plus, there are over a billion people who subscribe to the religion that believes worshiping anyone besides Allah will buy you a one-way ticket into the fiery pits of Hell.&nbsp;&nbsp;Through reason, you can evaluate these choices and make a decision on reason, not on fear.

    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp;When you can come to a reasonable conclusion that preparing for the worst-case scenario is the most economically sound course of action (as in cost-benefit&#x2014;not necessarily financial), then the fallacy is not committed.

      <strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp;Like any argument, if it is agreed that logic and reason should take a backseat to emotion, and there is no objective truth claim being made, but rather an opinion of something that should or should not be done, then it could escape the fallacy.

        <strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp;It is legitimate to use ridicule when a position is worthy of ridicule.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a risky proposition, however, because of the subjectiveness of what kind of argument is actually ridicule worthy.&nbsp;&nbsp;As we have seen, misplaced ridicule can appear as a sign of desperation, but carefully placed ridicule can be a witty move that can work logically and win over an audience emotionally, as well.

      Reductio ad Absurdum
    </h1>

      <p class="uk-text-large" style="margin-top: -15px; font-style: italic">
        <strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;A mode of argumentation or a form of argument in which a proposition is disproven by following its implications logically to an absurd conclusion.&nbsp;&nbsp;Arguments that use universals such as, &#x201c;always&#x201d;, &#x201c;never&#x201d;, &#x201c;everyone&#x201d;, &#x201c;nobody&#x201d;, etc., are prone to being reduced to absurd conclusions.&nbsp; <strong>The fallacy is in the argument that could be reduced to absurdity -- so in essence, <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>&nbsp;is a technique to expose the fallacy.</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="Body">
        <strong>Logical Form:</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
        Assume P is true.
      </p>
      <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
        From this assumption, deduce that Q is true.
      </p>
      <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
        Also, deduce that Q is false.
      </p>
      <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
        Thus, P implies both Q and not Q (a contradiction, which is necessarily false).
      </p>
      <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
        Therefore, P itself must be false.

        <strong>Example #1:</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
        I am going into surgery tomorrow so please pray for me.&nbsp;&nbsp;If enough people pray for me, God will protect me from harm and see to it that I have a successful surgery and speedy recovery.
      </p>
      <p class="Body">
        <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;We first assume the premise is true: if &#x201c;enough&#x201d; people prayed to God for the patient's successful surgery and speedy recovery, then God would make it so.&nbsp;&nbsp;From this, we can deduce that God responds to popular opinion.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if God simply granted prayers based on popularity contests, that would be both unjust and absurd.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since God cannot be unjust, then he cannot both respond to popularity and not respond to popularity, the claim is absurd, and thus false.

        <strong>Example #2:</strong>

        If everyone lived his or her life exactly like Jesus lived his life, the world would be a beautiful place!

      <p class="Body">
        <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;We first assume the premise is true: if everyone lived his or her life <i>exactly</i>&nbsp;like Jesus lived his, the world would be a beautiful place.&nbsp;&nbsp;If this were true, we would have 7 billion people on this earth roaming from town to town, living off the charity of others, preaching about God (with nobody listening). Without anyone creating wealth, there would be nobody to get charity from -- there would just be 7 billion people all trying to tell each other about God.&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few weeks, everyone would eventually starve and die.&nbsp;&nbsp;This world might be a beautiful place for the vultures and maggots feeding on all the Jesus wannabes, but far from a beautiful world from a human perspective.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the world cannot be both a beautiful place and a horrible place, the proposition is false.

<li><span style="color: #cc3300; font-family: &quot;Liberation Sans&quot;, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; ">Proving too much</span>
    <p>
      - **Description:** Proving too much is a logical fallacy that occurs 
      when an argument reaches a desired conclusion in such a way that this 
      conclusion only becomes a special case or a corollary of a larger, 
      absurd conclusion. The fallacy arises because, if the reasoning were 
      valid, it would also apply to the absurd conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form:** If an argument leads to an absurd or obviously false 
      conclusion, then the reasoning must be flawed. The argument &quot;proves too 
      much&quot; if it extends its reasoning to an unacceptable or absurd 
      conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1:** Gaunilo’s critique of Anselm’s ontological argument 
      for the existence of God. Gaunilo argued that if Anselm's reasoning were 
      valid, it would imply the existence of a perfect island, which is absurd.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** Gaunilo's argument showed that if the same logic used 
      to prove the existence of God were applied to the concept of a perfect 
      island, it would lead to an obviously ridiculous conclusion. This 
      highlighted a flaw in Anselm's argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2:** Henry Coppée’s argument against slavery. He argued 
      that if one claims slavery is evil because it leads to situations where 
      masters can violently abuse slaves, then by similar logic, marriage and 
      parenthood are also evil due to the existence of domestic violence.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** Coppée used the same reasoning to draw an absurd 
      conclusion, showing that the original argument against slavery was 
      flawed. By demonstrating that the argument could lead to an equally 
      unacceptable conclusion about marriage and parenthood, he highlighted 
      the fallacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation:** Reductio ad Absurdum, where the argument is shown to 
      lead to an absurd or contradictory outcome to disprove the initial 
      reasoning.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip:** To avoid the fallacy of proving too much, ensure that your 
      argument does not lead to implausible or ridiculous conclusions. Test 
      your argument's validity by considering its broader implications.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception:** In some cases, proving too much can be a valid strategy 
      to demonstrate the absurdity of an opponent's argument, as long as the 
      larger conclusion is indeed absurd and not just normatively opposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact:** The term &quot;proving too much&quot; is often used in 
      philosophical debates and can be traced back to medieval and early 
      modern discussions of logic and argumentation.

  </li><li><span style="color: #cc3300; font-family: &quot;Liberation Sans&quot;, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; ">Pooh-pooh</span>
    <p>
      (Also Known As Dismissing an Argument, Ridiculing an Argument)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - **Name:** Pooh-Poohing an Argument
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Description:** Pooh-poohing an argument is a rhetorical fallacy in 
      which a speaker dismisses an argument as unworthy of serious 
      consideration, often by ridiculing it rather than addressing its 
      substance. It involves undermining the argument through derision rather 
      than rational critique.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form:** If an argument is dismissed as unworthy of 
      consideration through ridicule or contempt, without engaging with its 
      actual content, then the dismissal is a fallacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1:** A politician dismisses a policy proposal by saying, 
      &quot;Only someone who’s out of touch with reality would propose something so 
      silly,&quot; without addressing the actual merits or details of the proposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** The politician ridicules the proposal instead of 
      evaluating its substance, thus avoiding a serious discussion of its 
      merits or flaws.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2:** An academic scoffs at a new theory by calling it &quot;a 
      laughable fantasy&quot; and &quot;utter nonsense,&quot; without providing a reasoned 
      critique of the theory's claims or evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** The academic uses derision to dismiss the theory 
      rather than engaging with its arguments or evidence, thus avoiding a 
      substantive critique.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation:** Straw Man Fallacy, where an argument is misrepresented 
      and then dismissed. Pooh-poohing often involves ridicule without 
      engagement, while the straw man involves creating a distorted version of 
      the argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip:** To avoid pooh-poohing, address the argument’s substance with 
      reasoned responses rather than dismissing it with ridicule or contempt. 
      Engage with the actual points made rather than resorting to derision.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception:** In some cases, dismissing an argument with ridicule can 
      be a valid rhetorical strategy if the argument is genuinely trivial or 
      absurd. However, this should be done with caution and clear reasoning.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact:** The term &quot;pooh-pooh&quot; is an onomatopoeic expression 
      derived from the sound of contemptuous dismissal, historically 
      representing the act of spitting or snorting in scorn. It reflects the 
      act of dismissing something with a dismissive attitude.
    </p>
  <ul>
<li><span style="color: #606060; font-size: 8pt; ">Big lie</span>
    <p>
      - **Description:** The &quot;big lie&quot; is a rhetorical technique or fallacy 
      where a falsehood is presented as truth with such boldness and 
      repetition that people begin to accept it as true. It relies on the 
      scale of the lie rather than its veracity, exploiting the tendency of 
      people to believe something if it is repeated often enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form:** If a falsehood is stated with enough confidence and 
      repetition, it may be accepted as truth by the public. The lie is so 
      large that it appears too implausible to be false, and its repetition 
      helps solidify its acceptance.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1:** A political leader repeatedly claims that their 
      country has the highest economic growth rate in the world, despite 
      evidence showing otherwise. The boldness and frequent repetition of this 
      claim eventually lead many to accept it as true.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** The leader’s repeated assertion, despite being false, 
      is taken seriously by the public due to its sheer magnitude and 
      frequency. The “big lie” becomes accepted as reality by those who hear 
      it often enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2:** A corporation advertises a product as having 
      &quot;unmatched effectiveness&quot; and &quot;revolutionary results&quot; in curing a common 
      ailment, despite scientific evidence showing it is no more effective 
      than competing products. The repeated, grandiose claims cause many 
      consumers to believe in its superiority.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** The corporation’s exaggerated and repeated claims 
      make the product seem far superior to others, leading to widespread 
      belief in its effectiveness despite evidence to the contrary.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation:** Smaller Scale Lie, where the falsehood is not as grand 
      or repeated. The big lie involves more significant deception and 
      repetition, while smaller lies may not have the same level of impact.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip:** To guard against falling for the big lie, critically evaluate 
      the evidence and sources of information. Repetition and bold claims 
      should not replace factual verification.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception:** In some cases, a &quot;big lie&quot; can be a deliberate tactic 
      to mislead or manipulate public opinion. However, not every repeated 
      claim is a &quot;big lie&quot;; some may be honest errors or misjudgments.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact:** The term &quot;big lie&quot; is often associated with political 
      propaganda and was notably used by Adolf Hitler in his book *Mein Kampf* 
      to describe the use of large-scale lies to manipulate public perception.
    </p>

</li></ul>
</li><li><span style="color: #606060; font-size: 8pt; ">Think of the children</span>
    <p>
      - **Description:** &quot;Think of the children&quot; is a rhetorical strategy 
      where an argument is made by appealing to the audience’s emotions, 
      particularly their concern for children. It is used to elicit a strong 
      emotional reaction, often to persuade or dissuade people from a 
      particular viewpoint or action by invoking a sense of moral 
      responsibility or urgency regarding the welfare of children.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form:** If an argument appeals to the emotional concern for 
      children, it may be used to persuade others by evoking feelings of 
      guilt, compassion, or moral duty, rather than by presenting rational 
      evidence or logical reasoning.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1:** A campaign against a proposed policy argues, &quot;If this 
      policy is implemented, it will harm countless children and their 
      futures. We must reject it to protect them.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** The argument leverages emotional appeal to concern 
      for children to persuade the audience against the policy, rather than 
      addressing the policy’s actual merits or drawbacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2:** A political figure opposes a new regulation by 
      stating, &quot;This regulation will hurt families and children, leading to 
      increased hardship for the youngest members of our society.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** The political figure uses the emotional appeal of 
      protecting children to argue against the regulation, focusing on the 
      perceived negative impact on families and children rather than providing 
      a detailed critique of the regulation itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation:** Appeal to Emotion, where emotions are used more broadly 
      to influence opinions. &quot;Think of the children&quot; specifically targets the 
      emotional concern for children.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip:** To critically evaluate arguments that appeal to emotions, 
      such as &quot;think of the children,&quot; assess whether the argument is based on 
      sound evidence and logical reasoning or if it is solely designed to 
      elicit an emotional response.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception:** In some cases, appealing to the welfare of children can 
      be a valid consideration if it is part of a well-reasoned argument 
      supported by evidence. It becomes fallacious when it is used to distract 
      from the lack of substantive evidence or reasoning.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact:** The phrase &quot;think of the children&quot; has become a popular 
      catchphrase in discussions about emotional manipulation in arguments and 
      is often used ironically to highlight when an argument relies 
      excessively on emotional appeals rather than rational analysis.
    </p>
  </li><li><span style="color: #606060; font-size: 8pt; ">In-group favoritism</span>
    <p>
      (Also Known As In-Group Bias, In-Group Preference)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - **Description:** In-group favoritism refers to the tendency for 
      individuals to preferentially support, favor, or give benefits to 
      members of their own group (the in-group) over those from other groups 
      (the out-group). This bias often leads to unfair treatment or unequal 
      opportunities based on group membership rather than individual merit.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form:** If individuals show preferential treatment or 
      support for members of their own group over members of other groups, 
      despite comparable qualifications or merits, then this behavior 
      exemplifies in-group favoritism.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1:** A manager consistently promotes employees from their 
      own social circle or shared background, regardless of the qualifications 
      of other candidates.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** The manager’s bias towards promoting people with whom 
      they share a common background demonstrates in-group favoritism, 
      potentially leading to unfair advantages for those within their social 
      circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2:** A sports team’s fans exhibit more positive attitudes 
      and support towards players from their own country, while showing less 
      enthusiasm or even negative attitudes towards players from other 
      countries.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** The fans’ preference for players from their own 
      country, despite the players’ comparable skills and performance, 
      illustrates in-group favoritism based on national affiliation.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation:** Out-Group Discrimination, where individuals show bias 
      against those who are not part of their in-group. In-group favoritism 
      involves positive bias towards the in-group, while out-group 
      discrimination involves negative bias towards the out-group.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip:** To mitigate in-group favoritism, consciously evaluate 
      individuals based on their merits and qualifications rather than group 
      membership. Encourage diverse perspectives and equitable treatment in 
      decision-making processes.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception:** In-group favoritism can sometimes be a natural human 
      tendency, but it becomes problematic when it leads to systematic 
      discrimination or unfair treatment. Awareness and deliberate efforts are 
      required to ensure fair practices.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact:** In-group favoritism is a well-documented phenomenon in 
      psychology and sociology and has been observed in various contexts, from 
      workplace dynamics to national and ethnic identities. Studies have shown 
      that even minimal group distinctions, such as arbitrary labeling, can 
      trigger this bias.
    </p>
  </li><li><span style="color: #606060; font-size: 8pt; ">Invented here</span>
    <p>
      (Also Known As Local Bias, Home Bias)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - **Description:** The &quot;invented here&quot; fallacy is a cognitive bias where 
      people favor or give preferential treatment to ideas, products, or 
      innovations that originated locally or within their own country, often 
      dismissing or undervaluing equally effective or superior solutions from 
      outside sources.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form:** If individuals or groups preferentially support or 
      accept ideas and innovations based solely on their local origin rather 
      than on their objective merits, this behavior exemplifies the &quot;invented 
      here&quot; bias.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1:** A company opts to use software developed locally 
      despite superior and more cost-effective options available from 
      international vendors, simply because the local option was developed 
      &quot;here.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** The company’s preference for the local software, 
      regardless of its objective quality or cost-effectiveness compared to 
      international options, demonstrates &quot;invented here&quot; bias by valuing 
      origin over merit.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2:** A country’s government funds a domestic research 
      project at a higher rate than a similar international project, even 
      though the international project has more advanced technology and 
      greater potential impact.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** The government’s preference for funding the domestic 
      project over the more promising international one illustrates &quot;invented 
      here&quot; bias by prioritizing local origin over the project’s potential 
      benefits and quality.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation:** Out-of-Sight Bias, where ideas or innovations from 
      distant or unfamiliar sources are undervalued. &quot;Invented here&quot; focuses 
      on favoring local innovations, while out-of-sight bias concerns a 
      general undervaluation of unfamiliar ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip:** To avoid falling into the &quot;invented here&quot; fallacy, evaluate 
      ideas, products, and innovations based on their actual merits and 
      effectiveness rather than their origin. Consider a broad range of 
      options and be open to external contributions.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception:** Local bias can be justified in cases where local 
      products or solutions are designed to meet specific regional needs, 
      support local economies, or adhere to local regulations. In such cases, 
      local preference may be beneficial or necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact:** The &quot;invented here&quot; bias is a common phenomenon in 
      various sectors, including technology, politics, and consumer 
      preferences. It reflects a natural tendency for people to favor what is 
      familiar or close to home, even when external alternatives may offer 
      greater advantages.

Alternatively, one considers loyalty in concluding that the argument is true, false, or not worth investigating.
      </p>
      <p class="Body">
        <strong>Logical Form:</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
        X is loyal to Y.<br>Y makes false claim Z.<br>Therefore, X accepts Z as true due to X&#x2019;s loyalty to Y.
      </p>
      <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
        Y makes false claim Z.<br>It is implied that disagreeing with Y is disloyal.<br>Therefore, X does not question claim Z out of loyalty.
      </p>
      <p class="Body">
        <strong>Example #1: </strong>Cult leaders appear to have a magical level of influence over their followers. They can do no wrong, and anything they say must be true. This mindset is enforced by rewards and punishments related to loyalty. When Jim Jones claimed that hostile forces would convert captured children of the cult to fascism, no fact-checking was involved. Out of loyalty to the leader, Jones&#x2019; followers reasoned that suicide was a better alternative and &#x201c;drank the Kool-Aid&#x201d; (Flavor Aid). Nine hundred and nine inhabitants of Jonestown died of apparent cyanide poisoning. Three hundred and four of them were children.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Example #2:&nbsp;</strong>
      </p>
      <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
        Liberal Friend: Posts fake quote allegedly by a conservative.<br>Me: Asks for a source because the quote is unbelievable.<br>Liberal Friend: Refuses to seek the source because it &#x201c;sounds like something [this conservative] would say.&#x201d;
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;While my liberal friend did not insist the quote was true, he did refuse to investigate it further out of loyalty to his ideological position. In both politics and religion, people on social media uncritically accept or reject information based on loyalty to their ideology. These are implied arguments rather than explicit arguments. The implication is that because the information is in-line with/goes against the person&#x2019;s ideology, it must be true/false. This is a form of confirmation bias that is applied to a specific argument.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp;There is no fallacy when one claims to follow someone or support them out of loyalty; the fallacy is committed when loyalty is considered in their evaluation of a truth claim.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Tip:</strong>&nbsp;Be loyal to truth and reason, even if it is seen as disloyalty to an ideology.

      (Also Known As: Insular Thinking, Island Syndrome)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      &nbsp;**Description:** Island mentality refers to a mindset where individuals 
      or groups adopt an inward-looking perspective, often characterized by 
      isolationist attitudes and a focus on their own immediate concerns or 
      interests, while neglecting broader or external perspectives and 
      realities.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form:** If individuals or groups focus exclusively on their 
      own internal concerns or local context, disregarding broader or external 
      viewpoints and influences, this behavior exemplifies island mentality.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1:** A local community refuses to participate in regional 
      or national initiatives, believing that only their local issues matter 
      and ignoring the benefits of broader collaboration.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** The community’s focus on local concerns to the 
      exclusion of regional or national perspectives reflects island 
      mentality, as they prioritize their own immediate issues over potential 
      wider benefits.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2:** A company operates with a narrow focus on domestic 
      markets while neglecting global trends and opportunities, resulting in 
      missed chances for growth and innovation.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** The company’s inward-looking approach, where it fails 
      to consider global market trends and opportunities, demonstrates island 
      mentality by concentrating solely on domestic issues and ignoring the 
      broader international landscape.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation:** Global Thinking, where individuals or groups consider 
      and incorporate broader or external perspectives. Island mentality 
      involves narrow, insular thinking, while global thinking emphasizes a 
      more expansive and inclusive approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip:** To overcome island mentality, actively seek out and consider 
      external perspectives and opportunities. Engage with broader networks, 
      stay informed about global trends, and be open to collaboration beyond 
      immediate circles.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception:** In some cases, focusing on local issues or internal 
      concerns may be necessary and beneficial, especially if immediate or 
      specialized needs require attention. However, balance this with 
      awareness of broader contexts to avoid complete isolation.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact:** Island mentality can often be observed in various 
      contexts, from local communities and businesses to entire nations. The 
      term evokes the imagery of being cut off from the wider world, similar 
      to an isolated island, and highlights the limitations of an insular 
      perspective.

    <p>
      also known as: argumentum ad adium
    </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;Substituting spite (petty ill will or hatred with the disposition to irritate, annoy, or thwart) for evidence in an argument, or as a reason to support or reject a claim.

    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Logical Form:</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      Claim X is made.

      <strong>Example #1:</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      Aren't you tired of the political divisiveness in this country? Republicans know what they are talking about when it comes to immigration. Don't you agree?
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;This is a slick way of having someone agree with your claim. The arguer began by introducing a common idea that many people despise&#x2014;political divisiveness (thing Y). Then, made a claim (claim X) in which the person would have to show political divisiveness to reject, in effect, causing the person to substitute spite in the idea of political divisiveness for reason.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Example #2:</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      Jon: Why should I bother exercising while my spouse is on vacation stuffing her face with food.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;The reasons for exercising are independent of the Jon's wife's actions. The claim here is that Jon should not bother exercising. The claim is associated with the idea that his wife is &quot;stuffing her face with food&quot; (something Jon feels spite towards). Jon concludes that he shouldn't exercise. If Jon were using reason rather than the emotion of spite, he would find another reason not to exercise&#x2014;like the fact that he is too far behind on<i>&nbsp;The Golden Girls</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;reruns.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp;This doesn't apply to emotional, relatively insignificant arguments.

    <p class="Body">
      The claim is that Sib is not worthy of a ride in Eddie's car (an emotional/subjective claim). Although Eddie appeals to spite in his reason, he has the right to in this case.

      <strong>Tip:</strong>&nbsp;Be happy. Avoid spite in all of its forms.

  </li><li><span style="color: #606060; font-size: 8pt; ">Stirring symbols</span>
    <p>
      (Also Known As Emotional Symbols, Symbolic Appeal)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - **Name:** Stirring Symbols
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Description:** Stirring symbols refer to the use of powerful, 
      emotionally charged symbols or images to evoke strong feelings and 
      persuade an audience, often bypassing rational analysis. These symbols 
      are designed to generate an emotional response rather than a logical or 
      reasoned argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form:** If an argument or message uses emotionally charged 
      symbols or images to elicit strong feelings and influence opinion, 
      rather than presenting rational evidence or reasoning, it employs 
      stirring symbols.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1:** A political campaign uses images of national flags and 
      stirring music in ads to evoke patriotism and rally support, without 
      discussing specific policies or issues.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** The campaign relies on emotional symbols such as the 
      national flag and patriotic music to stir up feelings of national pride, 
      aiming to persuade voters without addressing substantive policy details.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2:** A charity uses heartbreaking images of suffering 
      children and dramatic music in its advertisements to encourage 
      donations, focusing on the emotional impact rather than providing 
      detailed information about how the donations will be used.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** The charity's use of emotionally charged images and 
      music aims to generate sympathy and urge action through emotional 
      appeal, rather than presenting a detailed and rational case for why 
      donations are needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation:** Rational Appeal, where arguments are based on logical 
      reasoning and evidence rather than emotional symbols. Stirring symbols 
      focus on emotional impact, while rational appeal emphasizes reasoned 
      argumentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip:** When evaluating messages that use stirring symbols, look for 
      substantive content and evidence behind the emotional appeal. Be 
      cautious of decisions or opinions swayed primarily by emotional imagery 
      rather than rational arguments.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception:** Stirring symbols can be effective in raising awareness 
      or mobilizing action in cases where immediate emotional engagement is 
      necessary, such as in emergency appeals or advocacy campaigns. However, 
      they should be complemented with substantive information to ensure 
      informed decision-making.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact:** The use of stirring symbols has a long history in 
      propaganda and marketing, dating back to ancient times. Iconic symbols 
      and emotionally evocative imagery have been powerful tools for 
      influencing public opinion and rallying support throughout history.

  </li><li><span style="color: #606060; font-size: 8pt; ">Judgmental language</span>
    <p>
      (Also Known As: Evaluative Language, Pejorative Language)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - **Description:** Judgmental language involves the use of words or 
      phrases that express a personal judgment, evaluation, or criticism, 
      often with a negative or biased tone. It is used to convey disapproval 
      or to influence opinions by framing a subject in a particular, usually 
      unfavorable, light.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form:** If language is used to express personal judgments or 
      criticisms, often with a negative or biased tone, rather than providing 
      objective information, it constitutes judgmental language.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1:** Referring to someone as &quot;lazy&quot; or &quot;incompetent&quot; 
      without providing specific evidence or context for the evaluation.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** The terms &quot;lazy&quot; and &quot;incompetent&quot; are judgmental 
      because they imply negative personal traits without objective support or 
      detailed explanation, focusing on disparagement rather than constructive 
      criticism.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2:** Describing a policy as &quot;flawed and misguided&quot; rather 
      than providing a detailed analysis of its shortcomings and offering 
      constructive alternatives.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** Labeling the policy as &quot;flawed and misguided&quot; uses 
      judgmental language by offering a negative evaluation without 
      substantive critique or discussion of specific issues, thereby 
      influencing opinions through evaluative rather than objective language.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation:** Neutral Language, which avoids personal judgments and 
      focuses on objective, descriptive information. Judgmental language 
      involves evaluative terms and personal opinions, while neutral language 
      aims for impartiality.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip:** To avoid judgmental language, focus on providing objective 
      evidence and constructive feedback. Use descriptive language and avoid 
      terms that imply personal judgments or criticisms.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception:** In some contexts, judgmental language can be 
      appropriate when clearly stated as personal opinion or when providing 
      subjective evaluations is necessary for the discussion. However, even in 
      such cases, it should be balanced with objective evidence and 
      constructive criticism.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact:** Judgmental language can significantly influence how 
      arguments and opinions are perceived. Its use in media, politics, and 
      everyday conversation often shapes public attitudes and can impact the 
      effectiveness of communication by focusing on emotional responses rather 
      than rational analysis.

  </li><li><span style="color: #606060; font-size: 8pt; ">Argumentum ad captandum vulgus</span>
    <p>
      (Also Known As Appeal to the Masses, Popular Appeal)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - **Description:** Argumentum ad captandum vulgus is a rhetorical 
      strategy that involves appealing to popular opinion or the desires of 
      the general public to persuade or gain support. It leverages the 
      emotional or popular appeal rather than logical reasoning or evidence to 
      convince an audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form:** If an argument is made by appealing to popular 
      opinion or the emotions of the masses, rather than relying on logical 
      reasoning or evidence, it is an example of argumentum ad captandum 
      vulgus.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1:** A politician promises significant benefits and perks 
      to voters to gain their support in an election, focusing on what is 
      popular or emotionally appealing rather than presenting detailed policy 
      plans.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** The politician uses appealing promises to attract 
      voter support by capitalizing on popular desires and emotions, rather 
      than engaging with substantive policy issues or rational arguments.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2:** An advertisement for a product highlights how many 
      people use it and how well-loved it is, rather than providing factual 
      information about its quality or effectiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** The ad appeals to the product's popularity to 
      persuade consumers, leveraging the idea that &quot;everyone else&quot; is using 
      it, instead of presenting objective evidence or rational reasons for its 
      effectiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation:** Argumentum ad Populum, where the appeal is to the 
      general public's emotions or desires, but it can involve more general 
      appeals to shared beliefs rather than specifically focusing on popular 
      trends. Argumentum ad captandum vulgus specifically targets popular 
      opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip:** To critically evaluate appeals to the masses, assess the 
      argument based on logical reasoning and evidence rather than its 
      popularity or emotional appeal. Consider whether the appeal addresses 
      substantive issues or simply seeks to sway opinion through popularity.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception:** In some cases, appealing to popular sentiment can be a 
      valid strategy, especially when it aligns with genuine values or 
      concerns of the audience. However, it should be balanced with factual 
      information and rational arguments.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact:** The term &quot;argumentum ad captandum vulgus&quot; is Latin for 
      &quot;argument designed to capture the crowd,&quot; reflecting its origins in 
      rhetorical strategies used in ancient Rome. It highlights how effective 
      appeals to popular sentiment can be in persuasion.

  </li><li><span style="color: #606060; font-size: 8pt; ">Appeal to gravity</span>
    <p>
      (Also Known As: Appeal to Seriousness, Appeal to Authority)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - **Name:** Appeal to Gravity
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Description:** The appeal to gravity, also known as appeal to 
      seriousness, is a rhetorical fallacy where an argument is made based on 
      the gravity or seriousness of the situation rather than on its actual 
      merits. It involves emphasizing the importance or severity of an issue 
      to persuade others, often bypassing rational analysis or evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form:**
    </p>
    <p>
      P1: X asserts Y, but not in a serious way.
    </p>
    <p>
      P2: (unstated) All statements not asserted seriously are false.
    </p>
    <p>
      C: Y is false.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1:** A leader argues that a particular policy must be 
      implemented immediately because the situation is &quot;critical&quot; and 
      &quot;requires urgent action,&quot; without presenting detailed evidence or a 
      rationale for why the policy is the best solution.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** The leader's emphasis on the urgency and critical 
      nature of the situation aims to pressure others into supporting the 
      policy without critically examining its merits or evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2:** A company insists on making a controversial change by 
      claiming it is essential for &quot;the future of the industry&quot; and &quot;the 
      well-being of employees,&quot; while providing little information on the 
      specific benefits or drawbacks of the change.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** The company uses the gravity of the situation to 
      justify the change, focusing on its importance and impact rather than 
      presenting a thorough analysis or justification.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation:** Appeal to Emotion, where persuasion is based on 
      eliciting emotional responses rather than on the gravity of the 
      situation. Appeal to gravity specifically emphasizes seriousness, while 
      appeal to emotion targets emotional reactions.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip:** To evaluate arguments that use appeal to gravity, look for 
      substantive evidence and logical reasoning. Ensure that the seriousness 
      of the situation is supported by clear, rational arguments rather than 
      being used to distract from a lack of evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception:** Emphasizing the gravity of a situation can be 
      appropriate when it genuinely reflects the seriousness of the issue and 
      is supported by evidence. However, it should be accompanied by detailed 
      reasoning and evidence to avoid manipulation through emotional appeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact:** The appeal to gravity, or seriousness, is often used in 
      high-stakes scenarios, such as crisis management or urgent policy 
      decisions. Its effectiveness depends on balancing the perceived 
      seriousness with solid evidence and rational arguments.
    </p>
  </li><li><span style="color: #606060; font-size: 8pt; ">Appeal to shame</span>
    <p>
      (also known as: appeal to mockery, the horse laugh, appeal to guilt, appeal to pride, argumentum ad superbium, ad hominem ridicule, appeal to humor, appeal to mockery, appeal to ridicule, horse laugh, refutation by caricature)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - **Description:** The appeal to shame is a logical fallacy that occurs 
      when an argument or statement is deemed &quot;shameful&quot; or &quot;guilt-inducing&quot; 
      to discredit the position of the person making it. It relies on 
      emotional pressure rather than rational argument to persuade by invoking 
      a sense of shame or guilt.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Shameful Opinion:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- P1: X asserts Y.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- P2: Y is shameful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- C: X is shameful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Shameful Person:**

    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- P1: X asserts Y.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- P2: X is shameful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- C: Y is false.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1:** &quot;Aren't you ashamed for supporting that policy? Only 
      morally depraved individuals would endorse such things.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** This argument uses shame to discredit the person's 
      support for the policy by implying that only those with poor moral 
      character would support it, rather than engaging with the policy’s 
      actual merits or drawbacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2:** &quot;Oh, you're only 13. You can't have a valid opinion on 
      economics. You should be ashamed of even trying to discuss this topic.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** This argument dismisses the person's opinion on 
      economics by attacking their age and implying that their youth is 
      inherently shameful or disqualifying, rather than addressing the 
      validity of their arguments.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Appeal to Ridicule:** Uses mockery or laughter to undermine an 
      argument, focusing on making the subject a target of humor rather than 
      engaging with the argument itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Appeal to Pride:** The inverse of appeal to shame, where an 
      argument appeals to one's sense of pride or honor, suggesting that 
      holding a particular position is something to be proud of.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip:** When encountering appeals to shame, focus on the substance of 
      the argument rather than the emotional pressure. Evaluate the claims 
      based on evidence and reasoning rather than being influenced by attempts 
      to induce guilt or shame.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception:** In some cases, pointing out moral or ethical failings 
      can be relevant, but it should be done with substantive arguments and 
      evidence rather than solely relying on inducing shame or guilt.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact:** The appeal to shame is often used in political discourse 
      and social media, where quick and emotionally charged arguments can 
      sometimes overshadow more reasoned and evidence-based discussions.

The intent is to shame the audience into accepting the claim without question, as they would not want to appear ignorant of something supposedly known by even the least educated. This tactic bypasses logical argument and evidence, instead appealing to the audience's fear of seeming uninformed.

      &#xa0;&#xa0;- Explanation: This claim leverages the fallacy by suggesting that the link between vaccines and autism is universally acknowledged, even by schoolchildren.

    <p>
      (also known as: appeal to disgust, &quot;argument from disgust. &quot;wisdom of repugnance&quot;, &quot;yuck factor&quot;)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - **Description:** The argumentum ad fastidium is a logical fallacy that 
      occurs when something is argued to be morally wrong or unacceptable 
      based on its perceived grossness or disgusting nature. It also involves 
      the reverse, where something is argued to be good simply because it is 
      beautiful or pleasant.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Grossness Determines Wrongness:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- P1: X is gross.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- P2: Gross things are wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- C: X is wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Beauty Determines Goodness:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- P1: X is beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- P2: Beautiful things are good.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- C: X is good.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1:** &quot;Homosexuality is wrong because it's disgusting,&quot; 
      where disgust is used to argue against the moral acceptability of 
      homosexuality.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** This example uses the feeling of disgust as a basis 
      for moral judgment, implying that because homosexuality might be 
      considered gross by some, it must be morally wrong, rather than 
      providing rational arguments or evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2:** &quot;Eating insects is gross, so it must be an 
      unacceptable practice,&quot; where the disgust at eating insects is used to 
      argue against the practice, ignoring cultural differences and potential 
      benefits.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** The argument dismisses the practice of eating insects 
      solely based on personal or cultural disgust, rather than considering 
      the nutritional value or cultural context in which it is practiced.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Appeal to Ridicule:** Uses mockery or humor to discredit an 
      argument by making it seem laughable or contemptible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Appeal to Beauty:** Argues that something is good or desirable 
      simply because it is beautiful or pleasant, reversing the logic of 
      disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip:** When encountering arguments based on disgust or beauty, focus 
      on the substance of the argument rather than emotional responses. 
      Evaluate claims based on rational reasoning and evidence rather than 
      visceral reactions.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception:** Disgust or aesthetic appreciation can be relevant in 
      discussions of cultural practices or ethical issues, but these feelings 
      should be supported by rational arguments and evidence, rather than 
      being the sole basis for judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact:** The term &quot;wisdom of repugnance&quot; was popularized by 
      bioethicist Leon Kass, who argued that feelings of disgust could 
      sometimes reflect deeper moral insights. However, this approach is 
      controversial and often criticized for relying on emotional responses 
      rather than reasoned analysis.

      <i>Clich&#xe9; thinking</i>&nbsp;is the fallacy when sayings like, &#x201c;leave no stone unturned&#x201d;, are accepted as truth, regardless of the situation -- especially if taken literally.

    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;Maura makes a good argument as to why Phillip should not buy any more tickets, but Philip abandons the reasoning process and makes an appeal to his intuition.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Exception: </strong>This doesn't include arguments where subjective feeling plays a significant role.

      Maureen: So who are you going to marry?

      Joanne: Martin. I have a much better feeling about my future with him than with Tony.

    <p>
      <strong>Tip:</strong>&nbsp;Intuition can be defined as the sum of our experiences reflected in the feeling of knowledge that cannot be articulated. For example, if one has 30 years of experience as a firefighter, they may &#x201c;know&#x201d; when not to open a door in a burning building but not be able to explain why rationally. The problem is, in the moment, intuition is indistinguishable from imagination. When we get these feelings, if time permits, we should do what we can to back them up rationally.

    <p>
      (Also Known As: Attention Bombing, Affection Bombing)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - **Description:** Love bombing is a tactic used to influence or 
      manipulate a person by overwhelming them with excessive attention, 
      affection, and flattery. While it can be employed positively or 
      negatively, it is often associated with abusive behavior or 
      psychological manipulation. It involves showering someone with praise 
      and emotional support to create a sense of dependency or to gain control 
      over them.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Manipulative Use:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- P1: X provides excessive attention and affection to Y.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- P2: Excessive attention and affection are used to influence or 
      control Y.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- C: X is using love bombing to manipulate Y.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Benign Use:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- P1: X provides excessive attention and affection to Y.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- P2: There is no pattern of abuse or manipulation following the 
      affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- C: X is not engaging in love bombing but is simply showing care.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1:** A new romantic partner showers someone with constant 
      attention, extravagant gifts, and declarations of love within a short 
      period, pressuring them to commit quickly to the relationship.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** This example illustrates how love bombing can be used 
      to accelerate relationship commitments and create a sense of dependency, 
      often masking underlying manipulative intentions.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2:** A parent uses love bombing techniques by dedicating 
      extensive one-on-one time, indulging every wish of their troubled child, 
      and providing lavish attention to improve the child's behavior and 
      emotional state.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** Here, love bombing is applied in a positive context 
      as a technique to enhance the child's emotional well-being, without the 
      intention of manipulation or control.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Manipulative Affection:** Uses affection and attention to gain 
      control or manipulate, often followed by a cycle of idealization, 
      devaluation, and discard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Romantic Courtship:** Involves genuine affection and attention 
      without subsequent abusive patterns or manipulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip:** To distinguish between love bombing and genuine affection, 
      observe the long-term behavior and intentions. Love bombing typically 
      involves excessive attention followed by manipulative or controlling 
      behaviors, whereas genuine affection is consistent and free of ulterior 
      motives.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception:** Love bombing is not necessarily harmful if it is a 
      sincere expression of care without any underlying manipulative intent or 
      patterns of abuse. The context and subsequent actions are key to 
      determining its nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact:** The term &quot;love bombing&quot; originated in the 1970s among 
      members of the Unification Church and has since been used to describe 
      various forms of excessive and manipulative affection.

<li><span style="color: #cc3300; font-family: &quot;Liberation Sans&quot;, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; ">Milieu control</span>
    <p>
      (Also Known As: Environment Control, Group Control, Cognitive Control)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - **Description:** Milieu control refers to tactics used to regulate and 
      manipulate communication and environment within a group. This includes 
      the use of social pressure, group-specific language, dogma, protocols, 
      and other means to foster group identity, limit external influence, and 
      promote cognitive changes in members. Originally used to describe 
      brainwashing and mind control, the concept has been applied more broadly 
      to various contexts of social and psychological manipulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Group-Controlled Communication:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- P1: X uses specific language, protocols, and social pressure 
      within a group.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- P2: These tactics restrict members' communication and exposure to 
      outside viewpoints.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- C: X controls the cognitive environment and communication of the 
      group.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1:** A religious cult enforces unique jargon, rituals, and 
      dress codes, while discouraging contact with outsiders and labeling them 
      as morally inferior.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** This example demonstrates how milieu control is used 
      to create a strong group identity and isolate members from external 
      influences, reinforcing the group’s doctrines and limiting exposure to 
      alternative perspectives.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2:** A totalitarian regime imposes strict media censorship, 
      controls educational content, and uses state-sanctioned language to 
      influence public opinion and suppress dissent.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** The regime’s control over information and 
      communication channels exemplifies milieu control by restricting the 
      public’s access to diverse viewpoints and promoting state-approved 
      ideologies.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Social Isolation:** Restricting members' contact with outsiders to 
      reinforce group cohesion and control.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Language Manipulation:** Using specific jargon and terminology to 
      distinguish between insiders and outsiders.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip:** To identify milieu control, look for signs of restricted 
      communication, group-specific language, and systematic isolation from 
      external viewpoints. These tactics are often used to reinforce group 
      ideology and limit critical thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception:** Milieu control is not necessarily harmful if it’s used 
      to enhance positive group cohesion without restricting members' ability 
      to engage with external perspectives or make independent judgments.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact:** The concept of milieu control was popularized by 
      psychiatrist Robert Jay Lifton in the context of brainwashing and mind 
      control techniques, but it has since been applied to various forms of 
      social influence and organizational behavior.

    <p>
      (also known as: victim card, playing the victim, self-victimization, 
      professional victim, victim mentality, Emotional Manipulation)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - **Description:** Victim playing is a behavior where an individual 
      presents themselves as a victim to gain sympathy, avoid responsibility, 
      or manipulate others. It involves exaggerating or fabricating distress 
      or harm to elicit a specific response or outcome from others, often to 
      deflect blame or secure special treatment.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Manipulative Use:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- P1: X claims to be a victim of circumstance or mistreatment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- P2: X's claims are exaggerated or untrue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- C: X is using victim playing to manipulate others or avoid 
      responsibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1:** An employee consistently blames their underperformance 
      on being unfairly targeted by their supervisor, despite evidence of 
      their own lack of effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** In this case, the employee uses victim playing to 
      shift focus from their own shortcomings to an external supposed 
      injustice, aiming to garner sympathy and avoid accountability for their 
      performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2:** A person frequently claims that everyone in their 
      social circle is out to get them or is conspiring against them, in order 
      to manipulate friends into giving them special favors or support.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** Here, the individual uses victim playing to create a 
      sense of solidarity or obligation among their friends, leveraging 
      perceived victimhood to gain advantages or benefits.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **False Victimization:** Fabricating stories of abuse or neglect to 
      gain sympathy or attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Exaggerated Victimhood:** Overemphasizing real but minor 
      grievances to elicit a stronger emotional response from others.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip:** To identify victim playing, observe if the individual 
      frequently portrays themselves as a victim in situations where evidence 
      suggests their claims are overstated or self-serving. Look for patterns 
      of using victimhood to avoid responsibility or manipulate others.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception:** Genuine victimhood involves real suffering and should 
      be treated with empathy and support. Distinguishing between genuine 
      cases and victim playing requires careful consideration of the context 
      and the individual's behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact:** The concept of victim playing is often used in 
      discussions of psychological manipulation and interpersonal dynamics, 
      highlighting how people may use emotional strategies to influence 
      others' perceptions and behaviors.

    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">

    <p class="Body">

      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;I am referring to myself here.&nbsp;&nbsp;While my upbringing was Catholic, and I have long since considered myself a Catholic, that is irrelevant to any defenses I make of Catholicism -- like the fact that many local churches do focus on helping the community through charity work.&nbsp;&nbsp;If I make an argument defending anything Catholic, the argument should be evaluated on the argument itself, not on the history of the one making the argument or how I came to hold the claims as true or false.

    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;In this case, Jake Tooten is the &#x201c;source&#x201d; who is viewed negatively (as a racist) because of his association with the organization referenced. Note that his &#x201c;association&#x201d; with this group says nothing about his beliefs, which makes this fallacious. It is even more fallacious due to 1) Jake being several steps removed from this organization and 2) the organization&#x2019;s history of racism rather than the organization&#x2019;s current position on racism.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      Callie actually was right, but for the wrong reason. Jake runs a Nazi youth group.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp;If one can demonstrate that the connection between the two characteristics that were inherited by association is causally linked, or the probability of taking on a characteristic would be high, then it would be valid. In example #1, if Delores supported the &#x201c;all men should be castrated&#x201d; position, we can call her an &#x201c;extremist.&#x201d; In example #2, if we used &#x201c;murdered children&#x201d; instead of &#x201c;against religion,&#x201d; the claim of being a &#x201c;very bad man&#x201d; would be justified. In example #3, if Jake appeared on the podcast titled &#x201c;I am racist, and you should be too,&#x201d; Callie&#x2019;s claim of Jake being a racist would be justified.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Tip:</strong>&nbsp;People change. Be forgiving of one&#x2019;s questionable past associations, especially if they realize and admit those associations were wrong.

    <p>
      (also known as: Reductio ad Hitlerum, reductio ad racism, Red-baiting, 
      reductio ad Stalinum, Gore's Law, playing the Nazi card, Hitler card, 
      Argumentum ad Nazium, Godwin's Rule, Godwin's Law of Nazi Analogies)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - **Description:** Godwin's Law is an internet adage that asserts that 
      as an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison 
      involving Nazis or Hitler approaches 1. In other words, as discussions 
      progress, someone is likely to make a comparison to the Nazis or Hitler, 
      often regardless of the topic or relevance.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P1:** In any extended online discussion, the likelihood of a Nazi 
      or Hitler comparison increases.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P2:** Once such a comparison is made, the discussion is often 
      derailed or becomes less constructive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **C:** Over time, online discussions are prone to devolving into 
      comparisons with Nazis or Hitler.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1:** In a debate about healthcare policy, a participant 
      compares their opponent's viewpoint to Nazi Germany's medical ethics.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** This example illustrates Godwin's Law by showing how 
      an unrelated discussion about healthcare policy ends up with a 
      comparison to Nazis, which can derail the conversation and reduce its 
      constructive value.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2:** During a discussion about internet privacy, someone 
      asserts that any restriction on online freedom is akin to the censorship 
      seen in totalitarian regimes like Nazi Germany.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** Here, the reference to Nazi censorship in a 
      discussion about internet privacy exemplifies Godwin's Law by 
      introducing an extreme and historical comparison that shifts focus away 
      from the original topic.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Hitler's Rule:** Similar to Godwin's Law, it focuses specifically 
      on comparisons to Hitler rather than Nazis in general.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Godwin’s Law of Analogies:** A broader interpretation that applies 
      to any extreme or irrelevant analogy in discussions.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip:** To avoid invoking Godwin's Law, focus on relevant, specific 
      arguments and evidence rather than making extreme historical 
      comparisons. This helps maintain the discussion's relevance and 
      constructive nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception:** In discussions where the topic genuinely involves 
      totalitarian regimes or historical comparisons with Nazi Germany, such 
      references may be relevant and not fall under Godwin's Law.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact:** Godwin's Law was coined by Mike Godwin in 1990 as an 
      observation of online debate patterns, and it has since become a 
      well-known principle in discussions about internet discourse and logical 
      fallacies

    <p>
      (also known as: Galileo argument, Galileo defense, Galileo gambit, Galileo wannabe)
    </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;The claim that because an idea is forbidden, prosecuted, detested, or otherwise mocked, it must be true, or should be given more credibility. This originates from Galileo Galilei's famous persecution by the Roman Catholic Church for his defense of heliocentrism when the commonly accepted belief at the time was an earth-centered universe.

    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Logical Form:</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      Claim X is made.
    </p>
    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">

      Therefore, claim X is true (or should be given more credibility).

      Lindi and Jonah claim that Elvis is still alive and living on the planet Hounddogian, in the constellation Bluesuede. When questioned about their odd beliefs, Lindi and Jonah confidently reply, &quot;You know, people thought Galileo was nuts, too.&quot;
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;Lindi and Jonah are making an extraordinary claim and offering no evidence to support their claim. They are using Galileo in an attempt to get the audience to doubt their skepticism about the claim.

    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;Although Sidney did not use the exact example of Galileo, the fallacy is the same. Any reference to a similar story counts.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp;Using Galileo or similar success stories to serve as effective inspirational anecdotes to encourage people to reach outside their comfort zone is not fallacious. It does not mean, however, that because they succeeded, that everyone else will or even can.

    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Tip:</strong>&nbsp;Remember that for every Galileo, there are millions of cranks, quacks, and wackos, and statistically speaking, those who use the Galileo defense are one of the latter.

    <p>
      - **Description:** Whataboutism is a logical fallacy and rhetorical 
      tactic used to deflect criticism by raising a different issue or 
      accusing the critic of similar or worse faults. It aims to divert 
      attention from the original topic by shifting the focus to a perceived 
      hypocrisy or another unrelated issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P1:** X criticizes Y for a particular fault or action.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P2:** Instead of addressing X's criticism, Y responds with a 
      different fault or action of X, or another unrelated issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **C:** The focus is shifted away from the original criticism, and 
      the conversation becomes about the new issue or accusation.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1:** When confronted about a company's poor environmental 
      practices, a representative responds, &quot;Well, other companies also 
      pollute the environment.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** The representative is using whataboutism to deflect 
      attention from their company’s practices by pointing out that others 
      have similar issues, rather than addressing the specific criticism at 
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2:** During a debate about a politician's corruption, one 
      side responds, &quot;But look at the corruption scandals in the opposing 
      party!&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** Here, whataboutism is employed to divert the 
      discussion from the politician's corruption by highlighting alleged 
      corruption in another party, thereby avoiding the scrutiny of the 
      original issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Red Herring:** A related but distinct fallacy where the diversion 
      involves introducing an irrelevant topic to mislead or distract from the 
      original issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Tu Quoque:** A specific type of whataboutism that focuses on 
      accusing the critic of hypocrisy by pointing out their own similar 
      faults or behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip:** To counter whataboutism, calmly steer the conversation back 
      to the original issue or criticism, focusing on addressing the specific 
      points raised without getting sidetracked by unrelated issues.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception:** When a comparison is relevant and directly related to 
      the original issue, it may not constitute whataboutism. Ensure the new 
      issue or comparison has a direct and pertinent connection to the 
      discussion.

      - **Fun Fact:** The term &quot;whataboutism&quot; is derived from the Russian 
      phrase &quot;что вы скажете об этом?&quot; (what do you say about this?), 
      reflecting its use in political discourse and propaganda to deflect 
      criticism and avoid accountability.

    <p>
      (also known as: appeal to distrust [opposite], appeal to trustworthiness, Appeal to confidence)
    </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;The belief that if a source is considered trustworthy or untrustworthy, then any information from that source must be true or false, respectively. This is problematic because each argument, claim, or proposition should be evaluated on its own merits.

    <p class="Body">
      This doesn't include trusting <strong>in</strong>&nbsp;someone or something. For example, when we trust our children that they will make the right decisions in a certain situation, we are not using fallacious reasoning. When we trust that our seat belts will work when they need to, we are not using fallacious reasoning. When we trust that our puppy will leave us a gift on the carpet if we don't let him out by 7:00 AM, we are not using fallacious reasoning. When we express trust in someone, we are essentially expressing a degree of confidence, <strong>not making an absolute claim of something being true or false</strong>.

      I read in the Wall Street Journal that pork bellies are a good investment. So could I borrow a million dollars to invest?
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;The <i>Wall Street Journal</i>&nbsp;could reasonably be seen as a trusted source (it doesn't matter if you agree or not, as long as the arguer thinks it is). In this case, the information appears to be more of an opinion than a fact&#x2014;and an investment prediction, which by its nature is risky and therefore its truth value is questionable.

      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;The <i>Global Enquirer</i>&nbsp;might not be known for its high-quality journalism and truthful reporting. However, even the most untrustworthy sources sometimes share true information. While it might be a good heuristic (rule of thumb) to be highly skeptical of any claims from such an untrustworthy source, such claims cannot be so confidently dismissed without a good reason.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp;As long as one is claiming a degree of confidence instead of assuming true or false, there is no fallacy. Trustworthiness does impact the level of confidence one should have, but not certainty.

    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;There is a strong emotional appeal here accompanied by the devaluation of statistics and data (i.e., facts) in favor of feelings in order to answer an objective question: has the economy improved?

      Judy: That's just wrong. You'll get arrested. Don't be a bad person!
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;Civil disobedience is just one example of something that is illegal but does not have to be immoral. Laws are created for many reasons, and only some are created for &quot;moral&quot; reasons (according to someone's moral code).
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Example #2:</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      Lucy: I cheated on my husband the other night.

      Lucy: Calm down! It's not like cheating is illegal or anything.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;Again, the law and one's moral code are not the same things. While there does tend to be overlap, assuming illegal is immoral or legal is moral without a rational argument connecting the two concepts, is fallacious.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp;Sometimes what is illegal is clearly immoral, and no justification is required. For example, if someone were to say, &quot;How could you kick that old lady while laughing? That is a horrible thing to do, and you can go to jail!&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Tip:&nbsp;</strong>Laws become archaic when they do not keep up with social norms and cultural changes. What was once deemed &quot;immoral&quot; could easily change to &quot;moral&quot; within a few years and vice versa. Never simply assume that laws are good and right; demand justification.

    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      It seems strange to suggest that because Bill is my opposition, he is wrong, but this is necessarily true if we hold that &#x201c;Only those who disagree with X are my opposition&#x201d; and &#x201c;X is demonstrably right.&#x201d; This wouldn&#x2019;t make logical sense if we didn&#x2019;t set the conditions so that anyone belonging to the group &#x201c;opposition&#x201d; would be wrong.

      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;The implication here is that men have nothing to add to the discussion. Ideas to reduce gender discrimination are independent of gender, that is, both men and women can have equally valid arguments.

    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp;A requirement for this fallacy is &quot;when the strength of the argument is independent of identity.&quot; There are arguments that do rely on identity. For example, claims of feeling and perception could be unique to certain groups.

  </li><li><span style="color: #606060; font-size: 8pt; ">Abusive analogy</span><p>
    <b>Description:</b>&nbsp;is a highly specialized version of the ad hominem argument. Instead of the arguer being insulted directly, an analogy is drawn which is calculated to bring him into scorn or disrepute. The opponent or his behaviour is compared with something which will elicit an unfavourable response toward him from the audience.<br><br><b>logical form</b><br>Person 1 states that X is true.<br>Person 2 states that Y is true and hasn't property X<br>Therefore, X must not be true<br>(but Y really is not too much like X)<br><br><b>Example #1:</b><br>Smith has proposed we should go on a sailing holiday, though he knows as much about ships as an Armenian bandleader does.<br><br>(Perhaps you do not need to know all that much for a sailing holiday. Smith can always learn. The point here is that the comparison is deliberately drawn to make him look ridiculous. There may even be several Armenian bandleaders who are highly competent seamen.)<br><br><b>Explanation:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The analogy may even be a valid one, from the point of view of the comparison being made. This makes it more effective, but no less fallacious, since the purpose is to introduce additional, unargued, material to influence a judgement.<br><br><b>Example #2:</b><br>If science admits no certainties, then a scientist has no more certain knowledge of the universe than does a Hottentot running through the bush.<br><br>(This is true, but is intended as abuse so that the hearer will be more sympathetic to the possibility of certain knowledge.)<br><br><b>Explanation:</b>&nbsp;The fallacy is a subtle one because it relies on the associations which the audience make from the picture presented. Its perpetrator need not say anything which is untrue; he can rely on the associations made by the hearer to fill in the abuse. The abusive analogy is a fallacy because it relies on this extraneous material to influence the argument.<br><br><b>Example #3:</b><br>In congratulating my colleague on his new job, let me point out tha has no more experience of it than a snivelling boy has on his first da school.<br><br>(Again, true. But look who&#x2019;s doing the snivelling.)<br><br><b>Explanation:</b>&nbsp;While politicians delight in both abuse and analogies, there are surprisingly few good uses of the abusive analogy from that domain. A good one should have an element of truth in its comparison, and invite abuse by its other associations. All other things being equal, it is easier to be offensive by making a comparison which is untrue, than to be clever by using elements of truth. Few have reached the memorable heights of Daniel O&#x2019;Connell&#x2019;s description of Sir Robert Peel:<br><br><b>Example #4:</b><br>&#x2026;a smile like the silver plate on a coffin.<br><br>(True, it has a superficial sparkle, but it invites us to think of something rather cold behind it.)<br><br><b>Explanation:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The venom-loaded pens of literary and dramatic critics are much more promising springs from which abusive analogies can trickle forth <b>Example #5:</b>&nbsp;He moved nervously about the stage, like a virgin awaiting the Sult (And died after the first night.) <b>Explanation:</b>&nbsp;Abusive analogies take composition. If you go forth without preparation, you will find yourself drawing from a well-used stock of comparisons which no longer have the freshness to conjure up vivid images. Describing your opponents as being like &#x2018;straightlaced schoolmistresses&#x2019; or &#x2018;sleazy strip-club owners&#x2019; will not lift you above the common herd. A carefully composed piece of abusive comparison, on the other hand, can pour ridicule on the best-presented case you could find: &#x2018;a speech like a Texas longhorn; a point here, a point there, but a whole lot of bull in between&#x2019;.

      Richard Dawkins, an evolutionary biologist and perhaps the foremost expert in the field, says that evolution is true. Therefore, it's true.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;Richard Dawkins certainly knows about evolution, and he can confidently tell us that it is true, but that doesn't make it true. What makes it true is the preponderance of evidence for the theory.

      How do I know the adult film industry is the third largest industry in the United States? Derek Shlongmiester, the adult film star of over 50 years, said it was. That's how I know.

    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;Shlongmiester may be an industry expert, as well as have a huge talent, but a claim such as the one made would require supporting evidence.

      <strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp;Be very careful not to confuse &quot;deferring to an authority on the issue&quot; with the <i>appeal to authority fallacy</i>. Remember, a fallacy is an <strong>error in reasoning</strong>. Dismissing the council of legitimate experts and authorities turns good skepticism into denialism. The <i>appeal to authority</i>&nbsp;is a fallacy in argumentation, but deferring to an authority is a reliable heuristic that we all use virtually every day on issues of relatively little importance. There is always a chance that any authority can be wrong, that&#x2019;s why the critical thinker accepts facts <i>provisionally</i>. <strong>It is not at all unreasonable (or an error in reasoning) to accept information as provisionally true by credible authorities.</strong>&nbsp;Of course, the reasonableness is moderated by the claim being made (i.e., how extraordinary, how important) and the authority (how credible, how relevant to the claim).
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      The <i>appeal to authority</i>&nbsp;is more about claims that require evidence than about facts. For example, if your tour guide told you that Vatican City was founded February 11, 1929, and you accept that information as true, you are not committing a fallacy (because it is not in the context of argumentation) nor are you being unreasonable.

<li><span style="color: #606060; font-size: 8pt; ">argumentum ad Lazarum</span>
    <p>
      (also known as: Appeal to poverty, Argument from Poverty)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - **Description:** Argumentum ad Lazarum is a logical fallacy where a 
      claim is accepted or rejected based solely on the financial status or 
      socioeconomic condition of the person making the claim. It suggests that 
      a person's argument is valid or invalid depending on their economic 
      situation, rather than the merits of the argument itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P1:** X is poor or of low socioeconomic status.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P2:** The validity of X's argument is judged based on their 
      poverty or lack of resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **C:** X’s argument is either accepted or dismissed because of their 
      financial status, rather than its logical or factual merit.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1:** A homeless person argues for increased social 
      services, and someone dismisses their argument by saying, &quot;What do you 
      expect from someone in your situation?&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** This example demonstrates argumentum ad Lazarum by 
      dismissing the homeless person's argument on the basis of their poverty, 
      rather than evaluating the argument’s substance or reasoning.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2:** A low-income advocate proposes a policy change, and 
      their proposal is rejected with the comment, &quot;Of course you'd support 
      that; you're just looking out for your own interests.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** Here, the advocate's financial status is used to 
      undermine the credibility of their argument, instead of considering the 
      policy proposal’s merits.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Argumentum ad Divitias:** The converse fallacy, where the 
      argument's validity is determined based on the speaker’s wealth or high 
      socioeconomic status.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Ad Hominem (Financial Status):** A broader category of ad hominem 
      attacks where a person’s financial status is used to challenge their 
      argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip:** Evaluate arguments based on their logical structure and 
      evidence rather than the personal or financial status of the individual 
      presenting them. Focus on the content of the argument itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception:** If the financial status of an individual is directly 
      relevant to the argument (e.g., a person’s experience with poverty is 
      used to inform a policy proposal), discussing their socioeconomic 
      condition may be relevant to understanding their perspective, but it 
      should not solely determine the argument’s validity.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact:** The term &quot;Argumentum ad Lazarum&quot; is named after Lazarus, 
      a biblical figure who was poor and lived in a state of destitution, 
      contrasting with the wealthy and ignoring his arguments or perspectives 
      based on his poverty.

  </li><li><span style="color: #606060; font-size: 8pt; ">Argumentum ad crumenam</span>
    <p>
      (also known as: appeal to wealth, Argument from Wealth)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - **Description:** Argumentum ad Crumenam is a logical fallacy where a 
      claim or argument is accepted or rejected based solely on the wealth or 
      financial status of the person making it. It implies that an argument is 
      more valid or convincing if the person presenting it is wealthy, or less 
      valid if they are not.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P1:** X is wealthy or of high socioeconomic status.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P2:** The validity of X's argument is judged based on their wealth 
      or financial status.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **C:** X’s argument is either accepted or given more weight because 
      of their financial status, rather than its logical or factual merit.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1:** A billionaire proposes a new business model and 
      someone agrees with it solely because the billionaire is rich.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** In this case, the agreement is based on the 
      billionaire’s wealth rather than the merits of the business model 
      itself, which is a fallacy as the argument’s value should be assessed 
      independently of the speaker’s financial status.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2:** During a debate about economic policy, a rich 
      individual’s opinion is given undue weight simply because they are 
      wealthy, while similar arguments from less wealthy individuals are 
      dismissed.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** This example shows the fallacy by giving undue 
      importance to the rich individual’s opinion based on their financial 
      status rather than the substance of their argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Argumentum ad Lazarum:** The converse fallacy, where a person's 
      argument is dismissed or accepted based on their poverty or low 
      socioeconomic status.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Ad Hominem (Wealth):** A broader category of ad hominem attacks 
      that involve evaluating the argument based on the speaker’s financial 
      status.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip:** Focus on the logical structure and evidence of arguments 
      rather than the financial status of the individual presenting them. 
      Evaluate the content of the argument independently of the speaker’s 
      wealth.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception:** Discussions about financial policies or economic issues 
      where the speaker’s wealth is directly relevant to their perspective may 
      warrant consideration of their financial status, but it should not 
      solely determine the validity of their arguments.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact:** The term &quot;Argumentum ad Crumenam&quot; comes from Latin, 
      where &quot;crumenam&quot; refers to a money bag, reflecting the fallacy’s 
      reliance on financial status rather than logical reasoning.

      Tom Cruise says on TV that Billy Boy Butter is the best tasting butter there is.&nbsp;&nbsp;Tom Cruise is awesome -- especially in MI4 when he scaled that building with only one suction glove; therefore, Billy Boy Butter is the best tasting butter there is!

    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;Tom Cruise&nbsp;might be awesome, and perhaps he really does think Billy Boy Butter is the best tasting butter there is, but Tom is no more an authority on the taste of butter than anyone else; therefore, to accept the claim without any other evidence or reason is fallacious.

      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;Mike Seaver is awesome, but Kirk Cameron, the actor that plays that character?&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if Kirk were super duper (which he might be, I don&#x2019;t know him), his views on the truth of religion are equally valid as yours, or anyone else's who determines what he or she considers to be the truth through faith.

    <p>
      (also known as: blind obedience, the &#x201c;team player&#x201d; appeal, Nuremberg defense, divine authority fallacy [form of], appeal to/argument from blind authority)
    </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;Asserting that a proposition is true solely on the authority making the claim. It is often the case that those who blindly follow an authority ignore any counter-evidence to the authority&#x2019;s claim, no matter how strong. The authority could be anyone or anything, including parents, a coach, a boss, a military leader, a document, or a god.

      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;Most of us begin our lives seeing our parents as the ultimate authority, and we experience their wrath when we question that authority.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, this bad habit is carried over into adulthood where we replace our parents with a coach, a boss, a teacher, a commander, or a god.&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather than question, we blindly follow.&nbsp;&nbsp;This fallacy has probably resulted in more deaths, pain, suffering, and misery than all others combined.

    <p>
      (Also Known As: Argumentum ad Populum (Minority), Appeal to Unusual 
      Opinion, Minority Opinion Fallacy)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - **Description:** The appeal to the minority is a logical fallacy in 
      which an argument is considered valid or more credible simply because it 
      is supported by a small or minority group. This fallacy assumes that the 
      less popular or less conventional view must be correct or superior 
      simply because it is held by a minority.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P1:** A claim is supported by a minority group or an 
      unconventional opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P2:** Because the claim is supported by a minority, it is 
      presented as being more valid or true.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **C:** The claim is considered valid or superior solely based on its 
      minority status, rather than on its logical or factual merits.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1:** &quot;Only a few scientists support this new theory, so it 
      must be true.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** This example illustrates the fallacy by assuming that 
      the theory’s truth is validated because it is supported by a minority of 
      scientists, without evaluating the theory’s evidence or logical basis.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2:** &quot;Most people disagree with this policy, but that’s 
      exactly why it’s worth supporting.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** Here, the policy is being defended not on its merits 
      but because it is opposed by the majority, implying that its minority 
      support is a reason for its validity.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Appeal to Popularity (Majority):** The converse fallacy where a 
      claim is considered valid because it is widely accepted by the majority.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Argumentum ad Novitatem:** A fallacy where something is considered 
      better simply because it is new or novel, which can sometimes overlap 
      with minority views.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip:** Assess arguments based on evidence, logic, and reasoning 
      rather than the number of supporters or the popularity of the view. 
      Popularity or rarity alone does not determine the validity of an 
      argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception:** In some cases, minority views might be valuable if they 
      offer unique insights or challenge prevailing biases, but their value 
      should be judged on their own merits and evidence rather than their 
      minority status.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact:** The appeal to the minority fallacy often occurs in 
      debates where unconventional or fringe opinions are promoted as being 
      superior simply due to their rarity, leading to a paradoxical situation 
      where rarity is mistakenly equated with truth.

  <p>
    <strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;Using a dictionary&#x2019;s limited definition of a term as evidence that term cannot have another meaning, expanded meaning, or even conflicting meaning.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a fallacy because dictionaries don&#x2019;t reason; they simply are a reflection of an abbreviated version of the current accepted usage of a term, as determined by argumentation and eventual acceptance.&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, dictionaries tell you what a word meant, according to the authors, at the time of its writing, not what it meant before that time, after, or what it should mean.

    <p class="Body">
      Dictionary meanings are usually concise, and lack the depth found in an encyclopedia; therefore, terms found in dictionaries are often incomplete when it comes to helping people to gain a full understanding of the term.

    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;The dictionary does not settle controversial issues such as gay marriage&#x2014;it simply reports the most current accepted definition of the term itself while usually attempting to remain neutral on such controversial issues.

    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Example #2:</strong>

    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;Armondo may be right, but the dictionary is not the final authority on all issues, especially social behavior.&nbsp;&nbsp;More modern usage, especially in a high school setting, takes precedence in this case.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp;The dictionary works well when the term in question is a result of a misunderstanding or ignorance.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example:

      Elba: Yes!&nbsp;&nbsp;That makes sense now!

    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;“Awful” did once mean “to inspire awe”, but there are 
      very few, if any, people who continue to use the term in this way.&nbsp;&nbsp;Just 
      because it makes her feel better, it cannot be assumed.

    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      Steve: I think it is fantastic that you and Sylvia are getting married!
    </p>
    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      Chuck: I cannot believe you think my getting married only exists in my 
      imagination!&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what fantastic means, after all.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, it is true &quot;fantastic&quot; was once most commonly 
      used as existing only in the imagination, but common use of this word 
      has a very different definition.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp;If a bogus, “modern”, definition is made up by a 
      questionable source, that won’t make all other sources “historical”.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Tip</strong>: Don’t call a housewife a “hussy” even though the word “hussy” 
      comes from the word “housewife” and used to refer to the mistress of a 
      household, not the disreputable woman it refers to today. They don’t 
      like that.

    <p>
      (also known as: argument from inertia, concorde fallacy, finish the job fallacy)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Description:</span>&#xa0;Reasoning that further investment is warranted on the fact that the resources already invested will be lost otherwise, not taking into consideration the overall losses involved in the further investment.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Logical Form:</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      X has already been invested in project Y.
    </p>
    <p>
      Z more investment would be needed to complete project Y, otherwise X will be lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, Z is justified.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Example #1: </span>I have already paid a consultant $1000 to look into the pros and cons of starting that new business division.&#xa0;&#xa0;He advised that I shouldn’t move forward with it because it is a declining market.&#xa0;&#xa0;However, if I don’t move forward, that $1000 would have been wasted, so I better move forward anyway.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Explanation: </span>What this person does not realize is that moving forward will most likely result in the loss of much more time and money.&#xa0;&#xa0;This person is thinking short-term, not long-term, and is simply trying to avoid the loss of the $1000, which is fallacious thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Example #2</span>: There are ministers, priests, pastors, and other clergy all around the world who have invested a significant portion of their lives in theology, who can no longer manage to hold supernatural beliefs -- who have moved beyond faith.&#xa0;&#xa0;Hundreds of them recognize those sunk costs and are searching for the best way to move on (see http://www.clergyproject.org) whereas many others cannot accept the loss of their religious investment, and continue to practice a profession inconsistent with their beliefs.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Explanation</span>: Of course, the clergy who have not moved beyond faith and are living consistently with their beliefs have not committed this fallacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Exception:</span>&#xa0;If a careful evaluation of the hypothetical outcomes of continued investment versus accepting current losses and ceasing all further investment have been made, then choosing the former would not be fallacious.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tip</span>: Is there any part of your life where you continue to make bad investments because you fear to lose what was already invested? Do something about it.

    <p>
      (Also Known As: Appeal to Tradition, Argument from Antiquity, Argumentum 
      ad Antiquitatem,argumentum ad antiquitatis)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - **Description:** The appeal to ancient wisdom is a logical fallacy 
      that asserts a claim or practice is valid or superior because it is old 
      or has been long-standing. This fallacy assumes that because something 
      has been traditionally accepted or practiced for a long time, it must be 
      correct or preferable.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P1:** X has been accepted, practiced, or believed for a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P2:** Longevity or tradition is presented as a reason for X’s 
      validity or superiority.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **C:** X is considered valid or superior simply because it is 
      ancient or traditional, rather than based on its actual merit or 
      evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1:** &quot;We should continue using this old medical treatment 
      because it has been used for centuries.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** This example assumes that the long history of the 
      treatment automatically makes it effective or valid, without evaluating 
      its current scientific evidence or effectiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2:** &quot;Our family has always followed this ritual, so it 
      must be the right way to do things.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** Here, the argument is based on the idea that the 
      longstanding nature of the ritual makes it correct, rather than 
      assessing its validity or relevance in the present context.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Appeal to Tradition:** Often used interchangeably with appeal to 
      ancient wisdom, but may refer more broadly to any long-standing practice 
      or belief, not just those that are ancient.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Appeal to Novelty:** The opposite fallacy, where something is 
      considered better simply because it is new.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip:** Evaluate claims or practices based on their current evidence, 
      logic, and relevance rather than solely on their historical or 
      traditional status. Longevity does not guarantee correctness.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception:** Some traditional practices may have valid reasons for 
      their endurance and could be supported by evidence or cultural 
      significance, but this should be assessed on a case-by-case basis rather 
      than assumed based on tradition alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact:** The term &quot;argumentum ad antiquitatem&quot; translates from 
      Latin as &quot;argument from antiquity,&quot; reflecting the fallacy’s reliance on 
      the age or tradition of an idea as its primary justification.

    <p>
      (also known as: Argumentum ad Naturam)
    </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;When used as a fallacy, the belief or suggestion that &#x201c;natural&#x201d; is better than &#x201c;unnatural&#x201d; based on its naturalness. Many people adopt this as a default belief. It is the belief that is what is natural must be good (or any other positive, evaluative judgment) and that which is unnatural must be bad (or any other negative, evaluative judgment).

    <p class="Body">
      The <i>appeal to nature fallacy</i>&nbsp;is often confused with the <i><a href="https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/logicalfallacies/Naturalistic-Fallacy" target="fallacy" data-toggle="tooltip" title="" data-original-title="When the conclusion expresses what ought to be, based only on what is, or what ought not to be, based on what is not.">naturalistic fallacy</a></i>&nbsp;and the <i><a href="https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/logicalfallacies/Moralistic-Fallacy" target="fallacy" data-toggle="tooltip" title="" data-original-title="When the conclusion expresses what is, based only on what one believes ought to be, or what isn&#x2019;t is based on what one believes ought not to be.">moralistic fallacy</a></i>&nbsp;because they are quite similar. The <i>appeal to nature</i>, however, specifically references &#x201c;natural&#x201d; or &#x201c;unnatural&#x201d; and can also make a non-moral judgment such as &#x201c;beautiful&#x201d; or &#x201c;destructive.&#x201d;

      <p class="Body">
        <strong>Variation:</strong>&nbsp;The<i>&nbsp;naturalistic fallacy</i>&nbsp;can be seen as a subset of the <i>appeal to nature</i>, or a more specific version that makes a moralistic value claim rather than the more generic claim of goodness. For example, saying that cocaine is good for you because it is natural is an example of the <i>appeal to nature</i>. This has nothing to do with morality, but with health. Saying that polyamorous behavior (having multiple sexual partners) is morally good because it seems to be in line with our natural tendencies is an example of the <i>naturalistic fallacy</i>. If one were to say that the first example was an example of the <i>naturalistic fallacy</i>, they would be incorrect. If one were to argue that the second was an example of the <i>appeal to nature</i>, they wouldn't be wrong (if they are equating moral actions with goodness), but they could be more accurate. Just as some dogs are Great Danes but not all dogs are Great Danes, some appeals to nature can be naturalistic fallacies, but not all appeals to nature are naturalistic fallacies.

      - **Name:** Argumentum ad Antiquitatis
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Also Known As:** Appeal to Tradition, Appeal to Ancient Wisdom, 
      Argument from Antiquity
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Description:** Argumentum ad Antiquitatis is a logical fallacy that 
      asserts a claim or practice is valid or superior simply because it is 
      old or has been long-standing. This fallacy relies on the idea that the 
      age or traditional nature of an argument is a justification for its 
      correctness or value.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P1:** X has been accepted, practiced, or believed for a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P2:** The length of time or tradition is presented as evidence of 
      X’s validity or superiority.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **C:** Therefore, X is considered valid or superior simply due to 
      its antiquity or long-standing tradition, rather than being evaluated on 
      its current merits or evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1:** &quot;This method of farming should be continued because it 
      has been used for centuries.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** This example assumes that the historical longevity of 
      the farming method automatically makes it effective or valid, without 
      considering whether modern advancements or evidence might offer better 
      alternatives.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2:** &quot;We should follow this old legal principle because it 
      has been part of our laws for centuries.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** Here, the argument is based on the principle's 
      historical duration as justification for its continued use, rather than 
      examining if the principle still serves justice or fits contemporary 
      needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Appeal to Tradition:** Often used interchangeably, but can also 
      apply more broadly to any long-standing practice or belief, not just 
      those that are ancient.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Appeal to Novelty:** The opposite fallacy, where something is 
      considered superior simply because it is new.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip:** Assess claims or practices based on current evidence, logical 
      reasoning, and relevance rather than solely on their historical or 
      traditional status. Age alone does not guarantee correctness.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception:** Some long-standing practices may have enduring value 
      due to their continued effectiveness or cultural significance, but this 
      should be evaluated independently of their age or tradition.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact:** The term &quot;argumentum ad antiquitatem&quot; comes from Latin, 
      meaning &quot;argument from antiquity,&quot; highlighting how arguments based on 
      age or tradition often ignore the need for rational justification.

    <strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;When the claim that most or many people in general or of a particular group accept a belief as true is presented as evidence for the claim. Accepting another person&#x2019;s belief, or many people&#x2019;s beliefs, without demanding evidence as to why that person accepts the belief, is lazy thinking and a dangerous way to accept information.

    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      Up until the late 16th century, most people believed that the earth was the center of the universe.&nbsp;&nbsp;This was seen as enough of a reason back then to accept this as true.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;The <i>geocentric model</i>&nbsp;was an observation (limited) and faith-based, but most who accepted the model did so based on the common and accepted belief of the time, not on their own observations, calculations, and/or reasoning.&nbsp;&nbsp;It was people like Copernicus, Galileo, and Kepler, who refused to <em>appeal to the common belief</em>&nbsp;and uncovered a truth not obvious to the rest of humanity.

    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;Anyone who believes in virgin births does not have empirical evidence for his or her belief.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a claim accepted on faith, which is an individual and subjective form of accepting information, that should not have any effect on your beliefs.&nbsp;&nbsp;Don&#x2019;t forget that there was a time that the common beliefs included a flat earth, earth-centered universe, and demon possession as the cause of most illness.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp;Sometimes there are good reasons to think that the common belief is held by people who do have good evidence for believing.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if virtually all of earth scientists accept that the universe is approximately 13.7 billion years old, it is wise to believe them because they will be able to present objective and empirical evidence as to why they believe.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">

      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;Buttering up the audience is actually a technique that is suggested&#x2014;because it is effective.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you know your argument is weak, and compensate by laying on the charm, you are guilty of this fallacious tactic.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are letting the charm affect your decision, you are also committing the fallacy.

      Description: The assumption that because an individual is not in

    </p>
    <p>
      Exception: It is just as wrong to assume that the one is &quot;out of 
      formation&quot; as it is to assume that all the rest must be &quot;out of 
      formation.&quot; While it might be statistically more probable that the one

      This is similar to the<em>&nbsp;<i><a href="https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/logicalfallacies/nutpicking-fallacy.html" target="fallacy" data-toggle="tooltip" title="" data-original-title="When someone presents an atypical or weak member of a group as if they are a typical or strong representative.">nutpicking fallacy</a></i>&nbsp;</em>in that the group outliers and the &#x201c;nuts&#x201d; are equally as embarrassing or damaging to the group, but with the <em>imposter fallacy</em>, the outliers are claimed to be actors or imposters. This is also similar to the <em>no true Scotsman fallacy</em>&nbsp;in that a foundational claim is that no &#x201c;true&#x201d; group member would act in this way, so they must be an imposter.

    <p>
      <strong>Logical Form:</strong>

    <p style="padding-left: 40px">
      <font color="rgb(52, 73, 94)"><em>Group A comprises members X,Y, and Z who act in a way that damages group A&#x2019;s reputation.</em></font><br><font color="rgb(52, 73, 94)"><em>Person 1 suggests or claims, with insufficient evidence, that members X,Y, and Z are actually part of Group B who are there to make Group A look bad.</em></font>

      <strong>Example #1:</strong>
    </p>
    <p style="padding-left: 40px">

    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;There is no question that imposters exist. It is not uncommon that political rivals will pretend to be the worst of the other group with the goal of damaging the other group&#x2019;s reputation. The problem here is that Garry Godznguns has no evidence to back up his claim, and there is plenty of evidence to the contrary that white supremacists and white nationalists overwhelmingly support Trump.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Example #2:</strong>

    <p style="padding-left: 40px">

    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;While it is true that the guy arrested was a white nationalist who admitted vandalizing to make the protesters look bad, this was one case out of thousands. There is video documentation of known activists advocating for looting, vandalism, and even arson. The evidence strongly suggests the majority of destruction is not due to the imposters.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp;This is a fallacy contingent upon evidence. If enough evidence exists that the majority of the group outliers in question are imposters, then there is no fallacy.

    <p>
      <strong>Fun Fact:</strong>&nbsp;The imposter fallacy is often committed with the deceptive sharing fallacy when one shares a one-off story about an actual imposter.

    <p>
      (Also Known As: Excessive Belief, Cognitive Overcommitment)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - **Description:** Overbelief refers to an excessive or irrational 
      commitment to a belief, often despite conflicting evidence or the lack 
      of reasonable justification. It involves holding a belief with an 
      intensity that surpasses rational assessment or empirical support, 
      frequently leading to an entrenched and unyielding position.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P1:** Belief X is held with intense conviction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P2:** There is substantial evidence contradicting X or lacking 
      support for X.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **C:** Despite the evidence, the belief is maintained or intensified.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1:** &quot;Despite numerous scientific studies showing that 
      homeopathy is ineffective, some individuals continue to assert its 
      benefits with fervent conviction.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** This example illustrates how individuals can hold 
      onto a belief in homeopathy despite clear scientific evidence against 
      it, demonstrating overbelief by maintaining the belief strongly even 
      when contradicted by evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2:** &quot;A person may continue to support a political 
      candidate whose policies are failing to address critical issues 
      effectively, simply because they have an unwavering commitment to the 
      candidate.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** This shows overbelief in a political context where 
      the individual persists in their support for a candidate despite 
      evidence of ineffectiveness, driven by their strong personal commitment 
      to the belief.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Confirmation Bias:** This cognitive bias occurs when individuals 
      favor information that confirms their preexisting beliefs, contributing 
      to overbelief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Cognitive Dissonance:** The psychological discomfort experienced 
      when holding conflicting beliefs may lead individuals to overbelieve in 
      one belief to reduce discomfort.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip:** To counteract overbelief, critically evaluate your beliefs by 
      actively seeking out and considering evidence that challenges them. 
      Engage in open-minded discussions and be willing to adjust your views 
      based on new information.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception:** Overbelief can be mitigated if an individual is willing 
      to consider and integrate evidence that contradicts their beliefs. Being 
      open to change and questioning one's own convictions helps in avoiding 
      excessive commitment.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact:** The term &quot;overbelief&quot; is often used in psychological and 
      philosophical contexts to describe how deeply ingrained beliefs can 
      influence perception and reasoning, sometimes leading to persistent 
      adherence despite clear evidence to the contrary.

  </li><li><span style="color: #606060; font-size: 8pt; ">fallaca ancidentis</span>
    <p>
      (Also Known As: Fallacy of Accident, Fallacy of Misplaced Concreteness)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - **Description:** Fallacia accidentis occurs when an argument 
      improperly generalizes a specific case or attribute to apply 
      universally. This fallacy involves confusing an accidental property (a 
      feature that is not essential) with a necessary one, leading to 
      incorrect conclusions based on this misunderstanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P1:** A characteristic or condition X is true in a specific case A.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P2:** X is not essential or necessary for A but is mistaken as 
      such.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **C:** X is incorrectly assumed to be true in all cases or for all 
      entities.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1:** &quot;Since some people are excellent cooks and also 
      introverted, all introverts must be good cooks.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** This example demonstrates the fallacy by generalizing 
      a trait (being a good cook) based on an incidental characteristic 
      (introversion) rather than a necessary or inherent trait of all 
      introverts.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2:** &quot;A successful businessperson often works long hours, 
      so all people who work long hours will be successful in business.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** Here, the fallacy arises by assuming that working 
      long hours (an incidental feature) is a necessary condition for business 
      success, ignoring other factors that contribute to success.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Fallacy of Hasty Generalization:** This occurs when a broad 
      conclusion is drawn from a small or unrepresentative sample, similar to 
      generalizing an incidental feature to all cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Post Hoc Reasoning:** Attributing a result directly to an 
      incidental factor without proper evidence, often confusing correlation 
      with causation.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip:** To avoid fallacia accidentis, ensure that any generalizations 
      or conclusions are based on essential and necessary attributes rather 
      than incidental or accidental features. Carefully analyze whether the 
      characteristic in question is fundamental to the context.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception:** The fallacy may not apply if the characteristic in 
      question is genuinely universal and necessary within the specific 
      context being discussed, and not merely an incidental feature.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact:** The term &quot;fallacia accidentis&quot; is rooted in classical 
      logic and philosophy, illustrating how ancient thinkers sought to 
      identify and correct errors in reasoning that persist in modern 
      discussions and debates.

      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&#xa0;Mike made one claim: that he does not believe in any gods.&#xa0;&#xa0;From that, we can deduce a few things, like he is not a theist, he is not a practicing Christian, Catholic, Jew, or a member of any other religion that requires the belief in a god, but we cannot deduce that he believes we are all here by accident, nature is chance, and the universe created itself.&#xa0;&#xa0;Mike might have no beliefs about these things whatsoever.&#xa0;&#xa0;Perhaps he distinguishes between “accident” and natural selection, perhaps he thinks the concept of design is something we model after the universe, perhaps he has some detailed explanation based on known physics as to how the universe might have first appeared, or perhaps he believes in some other supernatural explanation.&#xa0;&#xa0;Regardless, this was a gross mischaracterization of Mike’s argument.

    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Exception:</strong>&#xa0;At times, an opponent might not want to expand on the implications of his or her position, so making assumptions might be the only way to get the opponent to point out that your interpretation is not accurate, then they will be forced to clarify.

    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Tip:</strong>&#xa0;Get in the habit of <em>steelmanning</em>&#xa0;the argument. The opposite of the <em>strawman</em>&#xa0;is referred to as the <em>steelman</em>, which is a productive technique in argumentation where the one evaluating the argument makes the strongest case for the argument, assuming the best intentions of the interlocutor. This technique prevents pointless, time-wasting bickering and demonstrates respect for both the interlocutor and the process of critical argumentation. Consider the following dialog:
    </p>
    <p class="Body" style="padding-left: 40px">
      <em><span style="color: rgb(52, 73, 94);">Johan: The progressive left is making it more difficult for me to vote blue this coming election.</span></em><br><em><span style="color: rgb(52, 73, 94);">Sebastian: Why is that?</span></em><br><em><span style="color: rgb(52, 73, 94);">Johan: It primarily has to do with the endorsement of the riots.</span></em><br><em><span style="color: rgb(52, 73, 94);">Sebastian: So if I understand you correctly, you are saying that the democratic establishment appears to be supporting riots rather than condemning them?</span></em><br><em><span style="color: rgb(52, 73, 94);">Johan: Yes, that is exactly it.</span></em>
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      At this point, Sebastian can present a case for why Johan’s argument fails—his actual argument. Sebastian will also likely be taken more seriously by Johan since he demonstrated goodwill in his attempt to accurately portray Johan’s argument.

      <strong>Variations:</strong>&nbsp;The <em>Black Swan Fallacy</em>&nbsp;is committed when one claims, based on past experience, contradictory evidence or claims must be rejected. It is treating the heuristic of induction like an algorithm. The name comes from the claim that &#x201c;all swans are white&#x201d; because nobody has ever seen a black swan before... until they did. The reasonable position to hold, assuming you existed in a pre-black-swan world, would be that &#x201c;all swans that we currently know of are white.&#x201d; Leave room for discovery unless it has been demonstrated that the contradictory evidence, or claims cannot possibly exist or such claims would be impossible. For example, claiming &#x201c;all triangles have three sides&#x201d; is both accurate and reasonable.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      The <em>Toupee Fallacy</em>&nbsp;is a cleverly-named variation of the appeal to ignorance where the absence of evidence is the result of the claim made being false. Consider the argument, &#x201c;all toup&#xe9;es look fake; I've never seen one that I couldn't tell was fake.&#x201d; The reason the person has never seen one they couldn&#x2019;t tell was fake is because when they did see one they couldn&#x2019;t tell was fake, they couldn&#x2019;t tell was fake. The same goes for penile enlargements and boob jobs.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      The <em>Appeal to Mystery</em>&nbsp;is a specific claim stating that the reason we cannot prove something is because &#x201c;it is a mystery.&#x201d; Rather than question if the claim is true, we accept that it is true and forego any more investigation by writing it off as a mystery. Why is it that I smell just fine after working out, but everyone else thinks I stink? It&#x2019;s a mystery!

<li><span style="color: #606060; font-size: 8pt; ">Evidence of absence</span>
    <p>
      (Also Known As: Absence of Evidence Fallacy, Lack of Evidence Fallacy)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - **Description:** The Evidence of Absence fallacy occurs when one 
      concludes that something does not exist or is not true solely because 
      there is a lack of evidence to prove its existence or truth. It is the 
      mistaken belief that if evidence has not yet been found, it does not 
      exist or cannot exist.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P1:** No evidence has been found to support the existence of X.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P2:** If X existed, there would be evidence for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **C:** Therefore, X does not exist.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1:** &quot;There is no evidence of extraterrestrial life on 
      Earth, so aliens must not exist.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** This example commits the fallacy by assuming that the 
      absence of evidence on Earth conclusively proves that extraterrestrial 
      life does not exist anywhere in the universe.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2:** &quot;We have not found evidence of a cure for a specific 
      disease, so it must be impossible to find one.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** This example assumes that the lack of current 
      evidence for a cure means that discovering one is impossible, ignoring 
      the potential for future discoveries and research.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Absence of Evidence as Evidence of Absence:** Using the lack of 
      evidence as a direct proof of non-existence or falsehood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Appeal to Ignorance:** Similar to the fallacy, where the lack of 
      evidence is used to argue for or against a claim.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip:** Evaluate the possibility of future evidence and consider that 
      current evidence might be incomplete or yet to be discovered. Avoid 
      concluding absolute non-existence based on the current lack of evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception:** In some cases, a complete lack of evidence may be 
      reasonable grounds for skepticism, especially if exhaustive searches and 
      studies have been conducted. However, it’s crucial to differentiate 
      between reasonable skepticism and outright denial of possibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact:** The term &quot;Evidence of Absence&quot; is often contrasted with 
      &quot;Absence of Evidence,&quot; which refers to the idea that the absence of 
      proof does not prove non-existence, but rather indicates a lack of proof.
    </p>
  </li><li><span style="color: #606060; font-size: 8pt; ">Appeal to censorship</span>
    <p>
      (Also Known As: Argument from Silence, Censorship Fallacy)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - **Description:** The Appeal to Censorship occurs when an argument 
      assumes that because a topic is censored, suppressed, or restricted, it 
      must be invalid, false, or unworthy of consideration. This fallacy 
      involves relying on the act of censorship as a means to discredit or 
      avoid discussing a particular idea or argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P1:** A topic, idea, or argument is censored or suppressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P2:** The act of censorship implies that the topic, idea, or 
      argument is false or invalid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **C:** Therefore, the topic, idea, or argument should not be 
      considered or is automatically discredited.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1:** &quot;The government has banned the book, so it must be 
      full of lies and misinformation.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** This example illustrates the fallacy by assuming that 
      censorship (the book being banned) is a valid indicator of the book’s 
      content being false or unreliable, without examining the actual content 
      of the book.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2:** &quot;You shouldn’t listen to that podcast because it was 
      removed from the streaming platform; it must be promoting harmful or 
      false ideas.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** Here, the argument relies on the removal of the 
      podcast from a platform as evidence of its negative value or falsehood, 
      rather than critically evaluating the ideas presented in the podcast.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Ad Hominem Fallacy:** Attacking the credibility of a source or 
      proponent of an idea instead of addressing the idea itself, often 
      involving claims of censorship or suppression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Red Herring:** Introducing irrelevant information (such as 
      censorship) to divert attention from the actual argument or issue at 
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip:** When evaluating arguments, focus on the content and evidence 
      presented rather than relying on external factors like censorship. 
      Censorship does not inherently determine the validity of an argument or 
      idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception:** The fallacy may not apply if the censorship is directly 
      relevant to the validity of the argument or idea (e.g., if it involves 
      legally prohibited content), but the focus should still be on the 
      argument's merits rather than the censorship itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact:** The term &quot;Appeal to Censorship&quot; is often used in 
      discussions about freedom of speech and the role of media in society, 
      highlighting the complex relationship between censorship and the 
      credibility of information.

    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;Since we use alcohol to clean viruses from our skin, it might be &#x201c;common sense&#x201d; that it would clean our insides too. But this is not the case. First, the alcohol needs to be high concentration, like 60% or more to be effective. Second, it does nothing to kill a virus in your body. Third, Don does need evidence if he is trying to convince Tony he is right, and he should demand evidence for himself before engaging in a risky behavior because of what he believes is &#x201c;common sense.&#x201d;

    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;FlatSam is attempting to justify his implied argument (the earth is flat) by appealing to &#x201c;common sense.&#x201d; He appears to be offering a reason (i.e., people on the bottom would fall off), but that reason is itself a claim &#x201c;supported&#x201d; by the appeal to common sense.

    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp;What is &quot;common sense&quot; to one might not be to another. It is possible one might not accept something that is &quot;common sense,&quot; so it could be argued that the error in reasoning falls on the person rejecting the assertion of common sense.

It isn't until Marty provides the Doc with extraordinary evidence (how he came up with the Flux Capacitor) that the Doc accepts Marty's claim.

      (also known as: argument from omniscience, &#x201c;how the hell can you possibly know that?&#x201d;)
    </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;The argument contains information that seems impossible to have obtained&#x2014;like it came from an omniscient author. This kind of writing/storytelling is characteristic of fiction, so when it is used in an argument it should cast doubt.

    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;Clearly the arguer could not know this unless the arguer was with the president all the time. We might assume that the arguer has some special knowledge and find this argument credible when we should only accept it as an opinion from someone who can't possibly know what he or she claims to know.

    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation: </strong>Claims of knowing the mind of God are highly dubious. While we cannot rule out &quot;divine revelation,&quot; we would need to weigh that possibility against the likelihood of a false belief.

      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;Larry may be an ass. He might have done many bad things. Heck, he might have even have ripped the &#x201c;do not remove under penalty of law&#x201d; tag off his mattress. However, to make claims of &#x201c;pure&#x201d; evil, one would have to be Larry. While making absolute claims about a person such as being &#x201c;pure evil&#x201d; might just be hyperbole, if we take the claim at face value, knowing the claim to be true would require the kind of omniscience reflected in this fallacy.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp;&quot;Seems impossible&quot; is not &quot;impossible.&quot; It might be possible that someone actually has the detailed knowledge they claim. We need to keep that option open when thinking probabilistically.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Tip:</strong>&nbsp;By simply adding an &#x201c;I believe&#x201d; to non-factual arguments and claims, you can avoid many fallacies and be more honest while exercising more humility.

    <p>
      (also known as: allness, absolute thinking, Omniscience Fallacy)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - **Description:** The Argument from Omniscience fallacy occurs when 
      someone assumes that because a person or entity is omniscient 
      (all-knowing), they are necessarily correct in all their claims or 
      judgments. This fallacy overlooks the possibility that even an 
      omniscient being might still face challenges or that their assertions 
      might be misinterpreted by others.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P1:** A person or entity is omniscient.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P2:** Omniscient beings are always correct.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **C:** Therefore, any claim or assertion made by this omniscient 
      being is correct.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1:** &quot;Since God is omniscient, the interpretation of the 
      scriptures given by religious leaders must be correct.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** This example assumes that because God is believed to 
      be all-knowing, the interpretations made by those claiming to understand 
      God’s will are necessarily accurate, which may not account for human 
      error or misinterpretation.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2:** &quot;If a person claims to have divine knowledge and is 
      assumed to be omniscient, then their statement about the future must be 
      true.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** This assumes that divine knowledge guarantees 
      accuracy in all predictions or statements about the future, disregarding 
      potential fallibility or miscommunication.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Divine Omniscience Fallacy:** Specifically involves religious or 
      divine claims.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Intellectual Authority Fallacy:** Broader form where expertise or 
      assumed superior knowledge is taken as infallible.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip:** Question the basis for the claim of omniscience and consider 
      that even if someone or something is assumed to be all-knowing, human 
      interpretation and understanding can still introduce errors or biases.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception:** The fallacy does not apply if the omniscience is not 
      assumed to imply infallibility or if the context involves a demonstrated 
      track record of accuracy in the claims being made.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact:** The concept of omniscience is often discussed in 
      philosophy of religion and theology, particularly in debates about the 
      nature of divine attributes and their implications for human 
      understanding.

    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;Refusal to share evidence is not necessarily evidence for or against the argument. Silent Bob&#x2019;s silence does not mean he took the keys.&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps he did, or perhaps he knows who did, or perhaps he saw a Tyrannosaurus eat them and was threatened by the king of the pixies not to say anything, or perhaps he just felt like not answering.&nbsp;

      Clifton: Wow. You convinced me!
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;The reason this technique works so well, is because <i>imagined reasons are often more persuasive than real reasons</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;If someone wants to be convinced, this technique works like a charm.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, to the critical thinker, this will not fly.&nbsp;&nbsp;Silence is not a valid substitute for reason or evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp;Generally speaking, absence of evidence is not evidence; however, there are many cases where the <i>reason</i>&nbsp;evidence is being held back can be seen as evidence.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first example, prompting Silent Bob to share a reason for his silence could result in a statement from Silent Bob that can be used as evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Tip:</strong>&nbsp;Silence can be very powerful. In public speaking, knowing when to pause and let the audience digest what you said helps them comprehend your message. In argumentation, a pause after making a solid point can increase the odds your interlocutor(s) will accept the point.

    <p>
      (Also Known As: Hairpiece Fallacy)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - **Name:** Toupée Fallacy
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;Survivorship Bias
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Description:** The Toupée Fallacy is an informal logical fallacy 
      that arises from selection bias and the problem of induction. It asserts 
      that because some toupées (hairpieces) are obviously fake, all toupées 
      must look fake. This fallacy occurs when someone generalizes about a 
      group based on a limited and non-representative sample, ignoring the 
      possibility of exceptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P1:** All toupées that have been observed are fake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P2:** No toupée that looks convincing has been observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **C:** Therefore, all toupées look fake.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1:** &quot;Every toupée I've ever seen looks obviously fake, so 
      all toupées must be fake.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** This example illustrates the fallacy by generalizing 
      about all toupées based solely on the subset of toupées that are 
      obviously fake, ignoring the existence of well-made toupées that could 
      look realistic.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2:** &quot;Since I've only seen bad toupées, it must be true 
      that no toupée looks real.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** This statement generalizes from personal experience 
      with only poor-quality toupées to a conclusion about all toupées, 
      without considering the possibility of high-quality toupées that might 
      not be noticeable as fake.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Inverted Toupée Fallacy:** &quot;Despite advances in forensic science, 
      undetected murders still occur,&quot; generalizing about all forensic 
      advancements based on cases of undetected crimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip:** To avoid this fallacy, ensure your generalizations are based 
      on a comprehensive and representative sample, and consider the 
      possibility of exceptions that might not be immediately visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception:** The fallacy does not apply if you have examined a 
      sufficiently large and representative sample that includes high-quality 
      examples, or if there's concrete evidence to support the generalization.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact:** The term &quot;Toupée Fallacy&quot; was popularized around 2006, 
      and it humorously highlights how selection bias and confirmation bias 
      can lead to erroneous conclusions in everyday observations.

    </p>
  
    <p>
      - **Description:** Argumentum ad Oculos is a rhetorical fallacy where an 
      argument is made based on the visual appearance or perception of 
      something rather than its actual merit or evidence. It assumes that if 
      something looks a certain way, it must be that way, without further 
      scrutiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P1:** Person X appears a certain way or makes a claim based on 
      appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P2:** Because of this appearance, the claim or nature of Person X 
      is accepted as true or false.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **C:** Therefore, the claim or nature of Person X is true or false 
      based solely on the appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1:** &quot;You don’t know how to make mistakes in the exam like 
      your neighbor. All has been officially written off.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** This example assumes that because a neighbor's 
      mistakes are visible or obvious, the official status or correctness of 
      the neighbor’s situation is clear, without considering other factors.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2:** &quot;They have sworn an oath, that they are in the middle 
      of the day. However, in two additional instances, they seemed to be 
      absent from the location during the stated time.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** This example illustrates the fallacy by focusing on 
      appearances or perceived evidence (absence during specific times) to 
      judge the truthfulness of an oath, without considering other possible 
      explanations or evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation:** Argumentum ad Iudicium (Appeal to Judgment) – A related 
      fallacy where judgments are based on superficial impressions rather than 
      a thorough examination.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip:** To avoid falling into this fallacy, it’s important to base 
      conclusions on comprehensive evidence and logical reasoning, rather than 
      relying solely on appearances or perceptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception:** This fallacy is less relevant if appearances 
      consistently match underlying facts or if thorough evidence supports the 
      observed appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact:** The term “Argumentum ad Oculos” reflects a focus on 
      visible or apparent qualities, highlighting how visual impressions can 
      sometimes mislead reasoning if not properly scrutinized.

<li><span style="color: #cc3300; font-family: &quot;Liberation Sans&quot;, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; ">El Greco fallacy</span>
    <p>
      (Also Known As:&nbsp;The Astigmatism Fallacy)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - **Description:** The El Greco Fallacy is a perceptual fallacy where it 
      is mistakenly assumed that perceptual abnormalities experienced by an 
      individual will affect their representation of the world in a similar 
      manner. It is named after the artist El Greco, whose vertically 
      distorted painting style was erroneously attributed to a supposed 
      astigmatism that distorted his view of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P1:** If an individual has a perceptual abnormality, they will 
      represent their surroundings according to that abnormality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P2:** El Greco's paintings are vertically distorted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **C:** Therefore, El Greco must have had a perceptual abnormality 
      (like astigmatism) that caused him to perceive and paint the world in a 
      distorted manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1:** &quot;El Greco's paintings are elongated vertically because 
      he must have had astigmatism that made him see the world in a distorted 
      way.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** This example incorrectly attributes the visual 
      distortion in El Greco's art to a physical perceptual defect, ignoring 
      that such a defect would also affect his view of his canvases, thereby 
      nullifying the supposed distortion.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2:** &quot;Research suggests that holding rods horizontally 
      makes doorways look narrower because people adapt their perception to 
      match their physical actions.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** This example assumes that perceptual distortions from 
      physical actions (like holding rods) directly alter visual perception, 
      without considering alternative explanations or the potential for 
      experimental bias.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation:** Misinterpretation of perceptual adaptation effects – 
      assuming that all perceptual changes are directly caused by physical 
      abnormalities or situational factors without considering other 
      influences.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip:** Be cautious of attributing perceptual phenomena solely to 
      physical or perceptual abnormalities without considering alternative 
      explanations or the experimental setup.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception:** The fallacy does not apply if empirical evidence 
      consistently supports a direct relationship between perceptual 
      abnormalities and specific perceptual distortions.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact:** The term &quot;El Greco Fallacy&quot; highlights a common 
      misconception in perception research, where assumptions about perceptual 
      experiences can lead to incorrect conclusions about the nature of 
      perception and its effects.

    <p>
      (also known as: argumentum a tuto, appeasement argument, Calm Down 
      Fallacy)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - **Description:** The Appeal to Calm Down is a logical fallacy where 
      someone dismisses or undermines an argument or concern by telling the 
      other person to &quot;calm down&quot; or &quot;take it easy.&quot; This tactic is used to 
      invalidate the emotional response rather than addressing the actual 
      issue or argument being presented.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P1:** Person A expresses concern or argument about an issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P2:** Person B responds by telling Person A to calm down or relax.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **C:** Therefore, Person A's concern or argument is invalid or not 
      worth addressing.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1:** &quot;I think we should discuss the budget cuts; they might 
      affect our team's resources significantly.&quot; — &quot;Just calm down, it's not 
      the end of the world.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** Instead of addressing the implications of the budget 
      cuts, the response minimizes the concern by telling the speaker to calm 
      down, thereby avoiding a substantive discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2:** &quot;I'm really upset about the new policy changes; they 
      feel unfair.&quot; — &quot;You need to calm down; it's not a big deal.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** The response dismisses the speaker's feelings by 
      suggesting that their emotional reaction is exaggerated, rather than 
      addressing the fairness of the policy changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation:** Appeal to Emotion (Calm Down) – Dismissing an argument 
      by focusing on the emotional state of the person making the argument 
      rather than engaging with the argument itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip:** When faced with the Appeal to Calm Down, try to refocus the 
      conversation on the substance of the argument rather than getting 
      sidetracked by emotional responses.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception:** The fallacy may not apply if the emotional reaction is 
      genuinely disproportionate and interferes with a constructive 
      discussion. However, it's important to address the underlying concerns 
      rather than dismissing them outright.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact:** The Appeal to Calm Down is often used in heated debates 
      or discussions as a way to deflect from the issues at hand and can 
      sometimes escalate tensions rather than diffuse them.

  </li><li><span style="color: #606060; font-size: 8pt; ">Appeal to Self-evident Truth</span><p>
    <strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;Making the claim that something is &quot;self-evident&quot; when 
    it is not self-evident in place of arguing a claim with reason. In 
    everyday terms, something is &quot;self-evident&quot; when understanding what it 
    means immediately results in knowing that it is true, such as 2+2=4. The 
    concept of self-evidence is contentions and argued among philosophers 
    based on their ideas of epistemology. This means that what is 
    &quot;self-evident&quot; to one person is not necessarily self-evident to another. 
    However, some ideas are clearly self-evident and some are not.

    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;People often confuse their own subjective feelings and 
      interpretations with self-evidence. Richie may believe that Lord Xylon 
      is the one true ruler of the universe, but his belief cannot be used in 
      place of evidence.

      It's self-evident.</span></em>
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;The fallacy is in the implied claim that the argument 
      needs no evidence or explanation because it is &quot;self-evident.&quot;
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp;This fallacy depends on the claim of “self-evidence” not 
      being self-evident. A claim that it reasonably self-evident would not be 
      fallacious:
    </p>
    <p class="Body" style="padding-left: 40px">
      <em><span style="color: rgb(52, 73, 94);">Richie: I exist.</span></em><br><em><span style="color: rgb(52, 73, 94);">Toby:

    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Tip:</strong>&nbsp;If you can't explain something, that doesn't mean you are 
      dealing with something that is self-evident; it could just be your 
      failure to explain something.

      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;In this case, it is clear that there is some underlying reason about which Slick Rick does not want the prospect to know.&nbsp;&nbsp;This reason, almost certainly, has something to do with the fact that Slick Rick can go lower if needed.

    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Exceptions:</strong>&nbsp;There is really no exception to this rule in argumentation or serious discussion.&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps this is acceptable in situations where you have the authority to choose not to make an argument out of a command, like in a parent-child relationship&#x2014;or perhaps your significant other has planned a surprise for you, and the &#x201c;you&#x2019;ll see&#x201d; is meant to deflect your inquiry for your own benefit.

      Ian: Why is the story of Abraham and Isaac regarded as such a &#x201c;beautiful&#x201d; Christian story?&nbsp;&nbsp;The guy was about to burn his son alive as a human sacrifice!

      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;One needs to ask, how do you know it is the will of God?&nbsp;&nbsp;Satan is said to be the great deceiver -- he would only be great if those being deceived couldn&#x2019;t tell the difference between God and Satan.&nbsp;&nbsp;In reality, appealing to Heaven, or God, is an abandonment of logic and reason, and as we have seen, potentially extremely dangerous.

    <p>
      (also known as: appeal to justice [form of])
    </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;Accepting evidence on the basis of wanting closure&#x2014;or to be done with the issue. While the desire for closure is a real psychological phenomenon that does have an effect on the well-being of individuals, using &quot;closure&quot; as a reason for accepting evidence that would otherwise not be accepted, is fallacious. This is similar to the&nbsp;<i><a href="https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/logicalfallacies/Argument-from-Ignorance" target="fallacy" data-toggle="tooltip" title="" data-original-title="The assumption of a conclusion or fact based primarily on lack of evidence to the contrary.  Usually best described by, &#x201c;absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.&#x201d;">argument from ignorance</a></i>&nbsp;where one makes a claim based on the lack of information because not knowing is too psychologically uncomfortable. However, the <i>appeal to closure</i>&nbsp;focuses on accepting evidence and for the reason of closure.

    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Logical Form:</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      Evidence X is presented, and found to be insufficient (or evaluated with a heavy bias due to the desire for closure).

    </p>
    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      Art: Why didn&#x2019;t it work out between you and Marci?<br>Steve: It turns out that she was a lesbian.<br>Art: Did you know she and Jack just got married?<br>Steve: [experiences a hard hit to his ego]
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;I heard from Suzi who told Tanya who told Jennifer that Marci simply thought Steve was a jerk but fed him the classic break up line, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s not you, it&#x2019;s me.&#x201d; Steve, being the alpha male he is, couldn&#x2019;t deal with this psychological trauma of not having a firm answer to why Marci didn&#x2019;t want to be with him, so based on the fact that Marci once commented that a supermodel had &#x201c;pretty eyes,&#x201d; Steve put the issue to rest by writing Marci off as a lesbian. Steve discovered that calling Marci a lesbian was actually just him projecting his own homosexual desires on Marci. Today, Steve is living happily with his partner, Ra&#xfa;l, and their white Persian cat, Mr. Muffins.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;Unfortunately, unsolved crimes are bad politically for those in charge and based on the number and percentage of false arrests, it is clear that appealing to closure has some serious consequences for many innocent people.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp;It has been stated elsewhere that &quot;agree to disagree&quot; falls under the <i>appeal to closure</i>. This is not the case because agreeing to disagree does not mean that either party is accepting the evidence of the other, in fact, it's the opposite. People can agree to &quot;move on&quot; or &quot;table the issue,&quot; for many logical reasons. This is similar to negotiation and compromise. When people compromise, they usually do not agree to accept evidence they wouldn't otherwise accept. For example, if an atheist and theist are debating the existence of the Biblical God, they wouldn't say, &quot;Okay, I'll agree that some kind of creator god exists if you agree that this god does not currently interfere in the universe.&quot;
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Variation:</strong>&nbsp;The <em>appeal to justice</em>&nbsp;is also about closure, but &#x201c;just&#x201d; closure. The concept of justice is the focus where the facts and reasoning are secondary. &#x201c;Do you want to live in a world where people can rob banks and get away with it? Then when it comes time for your verdict, vote Bad Boy Billy guilty!&#x201d;
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Tip:</strong>&nbsp;Remember that justice is a subjective term. When people cry &#x201c;justice,&#x201d; they often have created a narrative with very clear heroes and villains, when the truth is far more often unclear.

    <strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;An assertion is deemed true or false based on an assumed pretense of equality, where what exactly is &quot;equal&quot; is not made clear, and not supported by the argument.

      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;There are some good reasons that men should get some form of paid <strong>paternity</strong>&nbsp;leave, but they are not present in this argument. There is an unstated assumption that what benefits women get, for whatever reason, men should get the same.

    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;What do the &quot;same rights&quot; mean? Before gay marriage, men had the right to marry women, and women had the right to marry men. A man marrying a man is a different form of the &quot;right of marriage&quot; and needs to be argued as such. Again, there are many excellent arguments for gay marriage, but this isn't one of them.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Example #3:</strong>

    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;This argument implies that fetuses and babies outside the womb are equal, and ignores the fact that one is dependent on the resources of the mother's body to survive. Like with gay marriage, there are many excellent arguments for extending human rights to fetuses, but due to the <i>appeal to equality</i>, this isn't one of them.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp;There is quite a bit of subjectivity in the analysis of this fallacy. Is what is made equal, &#x201c;clear?&#x201d; Is this equality supported by the argument? Consider the following:
    </p>
    <p class="Body" style="padding-left: 40px">
      <font color="rgb(52, 73, 94)"><em>People of all races are equal. Human rights apply to everyone, so members of the HootchyCootchie Tribe on the Island of PiddlyWiddly have the right to marriage and family.</em></font>
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      Unless we are talking about two or more of the same thing (i.e., A=A), then we really mean &#x201c;equal in some way.&#x201d; Although not explicitly stated, &#x201c;equality&#x201d; is referring to having human rights, which seems pretty clear. The right to marriage and family is a universal human right, so this is supported by the argument.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Tip:</strong>&nbsp;Don't get outraged when one questions what you believe should be &quot;equal.&quot; Very often, either you really mean &quot;similar&quot; or you and your opponent have different concepts of what exactly should be equal.

    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;Claiming that something is true because the person making the claim has experienced, or is referring to someone who has experienced, some practical benefit from believing the thing to be true.

    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;Astrology is a pseudoscience that claims divine information about human affairs and terrestrial events by studying the movements and relative positions of celestial objects. Starbeam is almost certainly experiencing a host of cognitive biases, including the <em>confirmation bias</em>, where she notices the things that go wrong and ignores all that goes right on the days she forgets to read her horoscope. There is also likely some s<em>elf-fulfilling prophecy</em>&nbsp;going on where she interprets things that happen to her in a negative light, allowing her to maintain the belief in the power of horoscopes. Starbeam is committing the pragmatic fallacy because she is claiming astrology is true due to her &#x201c;evidence&#x201d; that horoscopes work for her.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Example #2:</strong>&nbsp;People all over the world under different religions that believe in all kinds of gods claim that their particular religion is true because of how believing in their religion makes them feel, the practical benefits they get from being a member of that religion (e.g., community support, social programs, etc.), their belief that they are loved, and more.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation: </strong>All of these reasons as to why religion &#x201c;works&#x201d; might be sufficient for why believing in a religion can be good &nbsp;but these reasons do not address the truth-claims the religion makes about the existence of gods, angels, an afterlife, a soul, and similar claims of existence.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp;This is not a fallacy when what is claimed to be true is the fact that something &#x201c;works,&#x201d; and works is defined subjectively (i.e., works for the person and not for everyone). For example, it is fair to say that prayer &#x201c;works&#x201d; when &#x201c;works&#x201d; is defined as giving (some) people a sense of peace and comfort.

    <p>
      (Also Known As: Semantic Apex Fallacy)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - **Name:** Apex Fallacy
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Description:** The Apex Fallacy occurs when someone evaluates a 
      group based on the performance of its top members, rather than a 
      representative sample of all members. This fallacy can lead to 
      misleading conclusions about the overall characteristics or abilities of 
      the entire group.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form:**
    </p>
    <p>
      P1: Of entities in set X, all entities in subset Y are Z.
    </p>
    <p>
      P2: (unstated) Y is representative of X.
    </p>
    <p>
      C: All entities in set X are Z.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1:** &quot;The world's best long-distance runners come from 
      Africa. Therefore, all Africans must be excellent long-distance runners.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** This is an Apex Fallacy because the conclusion 
      assumes that the exceptional performance of a few top athletes (subset 
      Y) is representative of all Africans (set X), ignoring that the majority 
      of Africans are not top long-distance runners.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2:** &quot;All the most powerful leaders are men. Therefore, all 
      men must be powerful.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** This is an Apex Fallacy because it assumes that the 
      power held by a few prominent men is representative of all men, ignoring 
      that most men are not in positions of power.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation:** Nadir Fallacy – This occurs when someone evaluates a 
      group based on the worst-performing members rather than a representative 
      sample.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip:** When evaluating a group or making generalizations, ensure 
      that the sample is representative of the entire group rather than 
      focusing only on extreme or exceptional cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception:** The fallacy may not apply if the exceptional cases are 
      statistically significant and representative, or if the analysis 
      explicitly controls for anomalies in the sample.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact:** The term &quot;Apex Fallacy&quot; is frequently discussed in 
      online forums related to gender issues, particularly in critiques of 
      feminism or in discussions about gender disparities in power and success.

    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Exception:</strong>&#xa0;When the data does exist, especially when it is empirically verified, but you just don't know what it is, it is acceptable to stick with your hypothesis and admit you don’t know the missing data off hand, but you can get it.&#xa0;&#xa0;For example:

  </li><li><span style="color: #606060; font-size: 8pt; ">Just world fallacy</span>
    <p>
      (also known as: Just world hypothesis, Belief in a Just World)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - **Description:** The Just World Fallacy is the cognitive bias that 
      assumes that the world is fundamentally fair, and that people get what 
      they deserve. This fallacy leads to the belief that bad things happen to 
      people because they somehow deserve it, while good things happen to 
      those who are deserving or virtuous.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P1:** The world is fair and just.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P2:** Individuals receive outcomes that reflect their moral 
      character or actions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **C:** Therefore, if something bad happens to someone, it must be 
      because they deserved it, and if something good happens, it is because 
      they were deserving.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1:** &quot;She must have done something to deserve her illness; 
      otherwise, why would such a thing happen to her?&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** This example illustrates the fallacy by attributing 
      an undeserved illness to the person’s supposed moral failings, rather 
      than considering other factors or random chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2:** &quot;He got promoted because he worked hard and is a good 
      person. People who are unsuccessful must not be trying hard enough or 
      are not as capable.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** This example reflects the fallacy by assuming that 
      success is solely due to personal merit, ignoring other factors such as 
      luck, privilege, or systemic issues.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Blaming the Victim:** Holding victims responsible for their 
      suffering or misfortune based on the belief that they must have done 
      something to deserve it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Moral Luck:** The idea that individuals are morally responsible 
      for outcomes that are beyond their control, due to a perceived fairness 
      in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip:** Recognize that misfortune or success can result from a 
      variety of factors, including luck and systemic issues, rather than 
      solely personal merit or fault.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception:** The fallacy may not apply in cases where there is 
      clear, direct evidence linking actions to outcomes (e.g., criminal 
      behavior leading to legal consequences), but it is still important to 
      consider the broader context and multiple contributing factors.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact:** The term &quot;Just World Fallacy&quot; was popularized by social 
      psychologist Melvin Lerner in the 1960s, who conducted experiments 
      demonstrating how people are inclined to believe in a just world to 
      maintain their sense of security and fairness.

      Bill the Eye Guy: The development of the eye is monophyletic, meaning they have their origins in a proto-eye that evolved around 540 million years ago. Multiple eye types and subtypes developed in parallel. We know this partly because eyes in various animals show adaption to their requirements.

      Toby: Uh, that sounds made up. I don't think the eye could have evolved.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, the evolution of the eye is confusing to non-biologists and those who are not familiar with evolutionary theory and natural selection. But the complexity of this argument is not a reason to reject it or find it less credible than a simpler claim (e.g. Zeus created eyes from clay).
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Example #2:</strong>&nbsp;If a layperson criticizes a complex policy about which they know nothing or very little, they are probably <i>appealing to complexity</i>.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;Black and white thinking is found where one has a lack of knowledge about a topic. Policies such as national healthcare are incredibly complex where each change has benefits and drawbacks. Non-experts often will dismiss a 1000-page document and say something such as, &quot;Look, it's simple. Do this, this, and this. Problem solved.&quot; No, it's not simple, and that wouldn't solve the problem.

    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp;When the one making the argument doesn't understand what they are actually saying, they are committing the <a href="https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/tools/lp/Bo/LogicalFallacies/47/Argument-by-Gibberish"><i>argument by gibberish</i></a>.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Tip:</strong>&nbsp;It is the job of the arguer to make the argument as clear as possible, and use language and terms that the audience can understand. This is a major problem in science communication. The <i>curse of knowledge</i>&nbsp;often leads to those trying to explain a complex topic in such a way where they assume the audience has as much knowledge in the fields as they do. If your audience fails to understand your argument, don't blame the audience;&nbsp;&nbsp;explain your argument differently.

      that occurs when a question combines two or more distinct issues, but 
      only allows for one answer. This can lead to unclear or inaccurate 
      responses, as the respondent cannot address each issue separately.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P1:** Question asks about multiple issues or topics.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P2:** Respondent can only provide one answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **C:** The answer may not accurately reflect the respondent's views 
      on each individual issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1:** &quot;Do you think that students should have more classes 
      about history and culture?&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** This question combines two distinct issues (history 
      and culture) into one query. Respondents may agree with one part (e.g., 
      more history classes) and disagree with the other (e.g., more culture 
      classes), but they can only provide a single response, which may not 
      accurately reflect their opinions on each issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2:** &quot;How satisfied are you with your pay and job 
      conditions?&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** This question asks about satisfaction with two 
      separate aspects of employment (pay and job conditions) in one question. 
      A respondent may be satisfied with one aspect but not the other, making 
      it difficult to gauge satisfaction with each individually.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation:** Trible (Triple, Treble)-Barreled Question – Similar to 
      a double-barreled question, but involves three or more issues.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip:** To avoid double-barreled questions, break down complex 
      queries into separate, simpler questions that address each issue 
      individually.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception:** If a question is designed to elicit a single unified 
      response about interconnected issues, it may not be fallacious. However, 
      care should be taken to ensure that the question accurately captures the 
      respondent's views on each component.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact:** The term “double-barreled question” is also used in 
      legal contexts, where such questions are referred to as “compound 
      questions” and can lead to objections in court proceedings.

    <p>
      (Also Known As: It Wasn't Me Defense)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - **Description:** The Shaggy Defense is a legal strategy where a person 
      denies an accusation with a simple claim of &quot;it wasn't me,&quot; despite 
      substantial evidence against them. The term is named after reggae 
      musician Shaggy's 2000 song &quot;It Wasn't Me,&quot; which features a narrative 
      of denying wrongdoing despite clear evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P1:** There is substantial evidence that the accused is involved 
      in wrongdoing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P2:** The accused denies involvement with a simple statement, &quot;It 
      wasn’t me.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **C:** The defense relies on the denial rather than addressing the 
      evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1:** During the R. Kelly trial, the musician was accused of 
      being the person in a video depicting illegal activities. His defense 
      was based on the claim that it was not him in the video.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** Despite the clear identification of R. Kelly in the 
      video, he maintained that he was not the person depicted, using a denial 
      as his primary defense strategy.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2:** In the 2010 Virginia court case Preston v. Morton, the 
      defendant denied being the driver of a truck involved in an accident, 
      even though evidence suggested otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** The defendant’s primary defense was the assertion 
      that he was not the driver, regardless of the evidence pointing to his 
      involvement.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation:** Trivial Denial - When a person denies involvement in 
      wrongdoing with a simple assertion, even when the evidence is weak or 
      non-existent.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip:** When using the Shaggy Defense, it is crucial to recognize 
      that denying the accusation without addressing the evidence often 
      undermines the credibility of the defense.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception:** If evidence truly does not support the accusation and 
      the denial is based on factual inaccuracies in the evidence, the defense 
      may be justified.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact:** The term &quot;Shaggy Defense&quot; became widely recognized after 
      Slate writer Josh Levin coined it in 2008, inspired by Shaggy's hit song 
      and its portrayal of denial despite clear evidence.

    <p>
      (Also Known As: The Loudest Wheel Gets the Grease)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - **Description:** This aphorism suggests that issues or concerns that 
      are vocalized or brought to attention are more likely to be addressed 
      compared to those that remain unnoticed or unvoiced. It implies that 
      making noise or drawing attention to a problem increases the likelihood 
      of it being resolved.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P1:** An issue or concern is brought to attention through 
      vocalization or complaints.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P2:** Issues that are vocalized receive attention and action.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **C:** Issues that are not vocalized are less likely to receive 
      attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1:** A customer repeatedly complains about a defect in a 
      product to the company’s support team, resulting in a quick resolution 
      or refund.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** By making their issue known through persistent 
      complaints, the customer draws attention to their problem, which prompts 
      the company to address it promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2:** A student who frequently raises their concerns about a 
      lack of resources in class may receive additional support or materials, 
      while quieter students might not receive the same level of attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** The student's vocalization of the problem leads to a 
      direct response from the educational institution, showing that 
      attention-seeking behavior can lead to solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation:** &quot;The squeaky wheel gets the grease&quot; can be contrasted 
      with proverbs from other cultures that emphasize the consequences of 
      standing out or making oneself too noticeable.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip:** If you want an issue to be addressed, make sure to raise it 
      clearly and persistently. However, balance is key, as excessive 
      complaining can sometimes be counterproductive.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception:** The principle does not always hold if the complaint is 
      perceived as unreasonable or if the system for addressing complaints is 
      ineffective.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact:** The proverb's origins are attributed to American 
      humorist Josh Billings, who popularized it in the 1870s, though its 
      exact origins remain uncertain. Similar sentiments are found in various 
      cultures, reflecting a common understanding of the importance of 
      advocacy and vocalization in problem-solving.

<li><span style="color: #606060; font-size: 8pt; ">Victim blaming</span>
    <p>
      (Also known as: Blaming the Victim)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - **Description:** Blaming the victim is a defense mechanism where the 
      responsibility for a crime or abuse is shifted onto the victim. This 
      often involves suggesting that the victim’s actions, choices, or 
      characteristics are to blame for the abuse they suffered, rather than 
      the perpetrator’s actions.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P1:** A crime or abuse has occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P2:** The victim's actions or characteristics are highlighted as 
      contributing factors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **C:** The victim is held responsible for the crime or abuse rather 
      than the perpetrator.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1:** A rape victim is criticized for wearing provocative 
      clothing, implying that their attire was an invitation for the assault.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** This shifts focus from the perpetrator's wrongdoing 
      to the victim's appearance, wrongfully suggesting that their clothing 
      justified the assault.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2:** After a natural disaster, people blame the victims for 
      not being prepared enough or for living in a risky area, rather than 
      addressing systemic issues or failures in disaster preparedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** This diverts attention from the lack of adequate 
      infrastructure or support systems to the supposed shortcomings of the 
      victims, minimizing the responsibility of authorities or systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation:** Denying the victim, which involves asserting that the 
      supposed victims are actually the real aggressors or that their 
      suffering is exaggerated or not valid.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip:** It is important to focus on the perpetrator’s actions and 
      address systemic issues rather than blaming victims, which can 
      exacerbate their trauma and discourage them from seeking justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception:** In some legal contexts, assessing the victim's actions 
      might be relevant to understanding the full context of the crime. 
      However, this should not shift responsibility away from the perpetrator.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact:** The concept of blaming the victim has been explored in 
      various fields including psychology and sociology, highlighting its 
      impact on how society perceives and handles crimes and injustices.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P2:** The claim is repeated several times.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **C:** The repeated assertion is considered to be proven or accepted 
      as true without further evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1:** &quot;It is clear that climate change is not a serious 
      issue. It’s just not a big deal. We should focus on more important 
      problems instead.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** The speaker asserts that climate change is not 
      serious and repeats this claim without providing evidence or engaging 
      with counterarguments. The repetition of the assertion is used in place 
      of proper proof.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2:** &quot;Everyone knows that our product is the best on the 
      market. It’s obvious because we say it is. We’ve always been the best.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** The speaker continuously asserts that their product 
      is the best without presenting specific comparisons, data, or evidence. 
      The repeated assertion is meant to convince the audience without any 
      substantive support.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation:** Proof by assertion can be seen in various contexts, 
      including advertising, debates, and political discourse. It may also 
      involve making repetitive claims that are not supported by evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip:** To avoid falling for proof by assertion, look for concrete 
      evidence and logical reasoning supporting the claims made. Repeated 
      statements should be scrutinized for their validity and substantiation.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception:** In some cases, repeated assertions might be used 
      strategically to reinforce a point or emphasize a widely accepted truth, 
      though this should still be supported by evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact:** Proof by assertion is often criticized for its lack of 
      intellectual rigor. It contrasts with more valid forms of argumentation, 
      which rely on evidence, logical reasoning, and critical analysis to 
      support claims.

<li><span style="color: #cc3300; font-family: &quot;Liberation Sans&quot;, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; ">Sealioning</span>
    <p>
      (Also Known As: Persistent Questioning, Troll Interrogation)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - **Description:** Sealioning is a tactic in which an individual engages 
      in an unreasonable, persistent, and insincere questioning of someone, 
      often with the intent to harass, derail, or exhaust the other party 
      rather than seek genuine answers. It involves a repetitive pattern of 
      asking for evidence or clarification in a manner that is often 
      disingenuous.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P1:** Person A makes a claim or expresses an opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P2:** Person B repeatedly asks for evidence or clarification in an 
      unrelenting manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P3:** Person B's questioning is not aimed at understanding but at 
      causing frustration or discrediting Person A.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **C:** The conversation is derailed, and Person A is pressured into 
      an endless cycle of responses without constructive dialogue.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1:** &quot;Can you provide sources for your claim that climate 
      change is accelerating? I need to see the data. Where are your sources? 
      How do you know they’re accurate? Can you explain this again? What about 
      this detail? Can you provide a peer-reviewed study to support this?&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** The individual asking questions is not genuinely 
      interested in the answers but is instead using this tactic to repeatedly 
      challenge the other person in a manner that is meant to be overwhelming 
      and disruptive.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2:** &quot;You say this policy will benefit everyone. Can you 
      provide a detailed breakdown of how it will help each demographic? How 
      will it address specific concerns? Can you show evidence from multiple 
      studies? What about the long-term effects?&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** The questioning is excessive and focused on 
      undermining the claim rather than engaging in a meaningful discussion. 
      The aim is to keep the discussion going in circles without reaching a 
      productive outcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation:** Sealioning can vary in its level of aggression and 
      persistence. It may involve multiple tactics, such as shifting 
      goalposts, making unreasonable demands for proof, or ignoring responses 
      to continue questioning.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip:** To handle sealioning, set clear boundaries for the discussion 
      and avoid engaging in an endless cycle of responses. If necessary, 
      disengage from the conversation and address the behavior directly if it 
      becomes disruptive.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception:** Not all persistent questioning is sealioning. Genuine 
      inquiries and constructive debate involve asking questions with the 
      intent to understand and engage in meaningful dialogue.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact:** The term &quot;sealioning&quot; originated from a comic strip by 
      David Malki!, in which a sealion repeatedly asks for evidence and 
      clarification in a manner that is both unreasonable and disruptive.

    <p>
      (also known as: is-ought fallacy, arguing from is to ought, is-should fallacy, Hume's law)
    </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;When the conclusion expresses what ought to be, based only on what is, or what ought not to be, based on what is not. This is very common, and most people never see the problem with these kinds of assertions due to accepted social and moral norms. This bypasses reason and we fail to ask why something that is,<i>&nbsp;ought</i>&nbsp;to be that way.

    <p class="Body">
      This is the opposite of the <i><a href="https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/logicalfallacies/Moralistic-Fallacy" target="fallacy" data-toggle="tooltip" title="" data-original-title="When the conclusion expresses what is, based only on what one believes ought to be, or what isn&#x2019;t is based on what one believes ought not to be.">moralistic fallacy</a></i>.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      A more traditional use of the <i>naturalistic fallacy</i>&nbsp;is committed when one attempts to define &#x201c;good&#x201d; as anything other than itself. The philosopher G. E. Moore (1873-1958) argued that it is a mistake to try to define the concept &#x201c;good&#x201d; in terms of some natural property (thus, the name &#x201c;naturalistic&#x201d;). Defining the concept &#x201c;good,&#x201d; Moore argued, is impossible since it is a simple concept; a concept that cannot be defined in terms of any other concept. Not all philosophers agree that this is a fallacy. Some have argued that ethical terms, such as &#x201c;good&#x201d; can be defined in nonethical natural terms. They believe that ethical judgments directly follow from facts, i.e., it is possible to argue from a fact to a value.

        <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;If we break this down, we can say the claim is that homosexuality (X) is not normal (X is not). We are arguing that homosexuality is morally wrong (X ought not to be) because it is not normal (X is not). The claim that homosexuality is not normal is based on defining normality as &#x201c;commonly occurring.&#x201d; We can see the flaw in this argumentation through a simple analogy: lying, cheating, and stealing are normal (in that most people do it at some time in their lives), but this doesn&#x2019;t make those actions morally good.

        Nature gives people diseases and sickness; therefore, it is morally wrong to interfere with nature and treat sick people with medicine.
      </p>
      <p class="Body">
        <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;If we break this down, we can say that the claim that nature gives people diseases and sickness is a declaration of what is (i.e., a natural property of the world). From this, we are deriving an ought (i.e., we ought not interfere...). The wording and order of these arguments can be confusing, but remember that the underlying fallacy here is the deduction of an ought from an is.

      <p class="Body">
        We go against nature (or what is) all the time. We cannot sometimes use nature as a moral baseline and at other times condemn her for her careless attitude and indifference toward the human race.

      <p class="Body">
        <strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp;At times, our morality will be in line with what is&#x2014;but if we are justifying a moral action, we need to use something besides simply what is.
      </p>
      <p class="Body">
        <strong>Fun Fact:</strong>&nbsp;The <i>naturalistic</i>&nbsp;and the <i>moralistic</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;fallacies are often confused with the appeal to nature fallacy. One reason, perhaps, is because what is &#x201c;natural&#x201d; is another way of saying what is, is. But with the <i>naturalistic</i>&nbsp;and the <i>moralistic</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;fallacies, the conclusion does not have to be based on what is &#x201c;natural;&#x201d; it just has to be based on what is. For example,

      moral correctness. It is often criticized when these expressions are 
      perceived as insincere or superficial, and are done primarily to enhance 
      the speaker's social status or self-image, rather than to contribute to 
      meaningful action or change.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P1:** An individual or group makes a public statement or action 
      expressing a moral or ethical stance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P2:** The primary intention behind the statement or action appears 
      to be the enhancement of their own social image or status.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **C:** Therefore, the statement or action may be considered virtue 
      signalling rather than a genuine effort to address the issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1:** A celebrity posts a photo on social media with a 
      hashtag supporting a social cause, but their overall actions do not 
      reflect any substantial contribution to that cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** The celebrity's social media post may be seen as 
      virtue signalling if it is perceived as an attempt to gain social 
      approval or enhance their public image, without corresponding 
      substantive actions or commitments to the cause they are endorsing.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2:** A politician publicly condemns a controversial issue 
      to gain favor with voters, but their legislative record shows little 
      effort to address the issue in practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** The politician’s public condemnation may be viewed as 
      virtue signalling if it is seen as a strategic move to appeal to 
      constituents, rather than a reflection of genuine concern or a 
      commitment to effecting real change.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation:** Virtue signalling can also occur in various forms, 
      including public statements, symbolic gestures, or performative acts 
      that are more about showcasing one’s moral stance rather than engaging 
      in meaningful action.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip:** To avoid being perceived as virtue signalling, ensure that 
      public expressions of moral or ethical stances are supported by tangible 
      actions and efforts that contribute to addressing the issues discussed.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception:** Virtue signalling can sometimes be a starting point for 
      genuine engagement if it leads to concrete actions and sustained efforts 
      to address the underlying issues.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact:** The term &quot;virtue signalling&quot; gained popularity in the 
      early 2010s and is often used in discussions about social media and 
      public relations, highlighting the complexities of online identity and 
      activism.

<li><span style="color: #cc3300; font-family: &quot;Liberation Sans&quot;, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; ">Hyperbolic discounting</span>
    <p>
      - **Description:** Hyperbolic discounting is a cognitive bias that 
      describes the tendency for people to prefer smaller, more immediate 
      rewards over larger, delayed rewards. This bias results in people 
      disproportionately valuing immediate gratification, often at the expense 
      of long-term benefits. It contrasts with exponential discounting, which 
      assumes a constant rate of time preference.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P1:** People often face choices between smaller rewards available 
      sooner and larger rewards available later.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P2:** People tend to prefer the smaller, sooner rewards, even if 
      the delayed reward is significantly larger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **C:** Therefore, people demonstrate hyperbolic discounting by 
      placing higher value on immediate gratification relative to future 
      benefits.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1:** Choosing to spend $50 now on a new gadget rather than 
      saving that money to invest in a larger purchase or investment 
      opportunity in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** The immediate pleasure of acquiring the gadget 
      outweighs the greater long-term value of saving or investing the money, 
      illustrating the preference for immediate rewards over future gains.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2:** Opting to watch a TV show now rather than spending 
      that time working on a project that could yield significant future 
      benefits, like career advancement.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** The immediate enjoyment of watching TV is prioritized 
      over the potential long-term benefits of completing the project, 
      reflecting the tendency to undervalue future rewards.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation:** Hyperbolic discounting can vary in strength depending 
      on the context and the individual’s self-control and long-term planning 
      ability. It is often more pronounced in situations where immediate 
      rewards are more tangible or emotionally satisfying.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip:** To mitigate the effects of hyperbolic discounting, create 
      structured plans with specific goals and rewards for achieving long-term 
      objectives. Setting up commitment devices can also help in sticking to 
      long-term plans.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception:** In some cases, individuals may exhibit less hyperbolic 
      discounting if they have strong future-oriented goals or if they 
      experience a high level of immediate urgency that overrides their usual 
      preference for short-term rewards.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact:** Hyperbolic discounting is often discussed in behavioral 
      economics and psychology, and it helps explain various phenomena like 
      procrastination and impulsive buying. It contrasts with the more 
      traditional economic assumption of exponential discounting, which 
      suggests a constant rate of time preference.

      (also known as: argument from inertia, concorde fallacy, finish the job fallacy)
    </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;Reasoning that further investment is warranted on the fact that the resources already invested will be lost otherwise, not taking into consideration the overall losses involved in the further investment.

    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      I have already paid a consultant $1000 to look into the pros and cons of starting that new business division.&nbsp;&nbsp;He advised that I shouldn&#x2019;t move forward with it because it is a declining market.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, if I don&#x2019;t move forward, that $1000 would have been wasted, so I better move forward anyway.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;What this person does not realize is that moving forward will most likely result in the loss of much more time and money.&nbsp;&nbsp;This person is thinking short-term, not long-term, and is simply trying to avoid the loss of the $1000, which is fallacious thinking.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Example #2:</strong>&nbsp;There are ministers, priests, pastors, and other clergy all around the world who have invested a significant portion of their lives in theology, who can no longer manage to hold supernatural beliefs -- who have moved beyond faith.&nbsp;&nbsp;Hundreds of them recognize those sunk costs and are searching for the best way to move on (see <a href="http://www.clergyproject.org/">http://www.clergyproject.org</a>) whereas many others cannot accept the loss of their religious investment, and continue to practice a profession inconsistent with their beliefs.

    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;Of course, the clergy who have not moved beyond faith and are living consistently with their beliefs have not committed this fallacy.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp;If a careful evaluation of the hypothetical outcomes of continued investment versus accepting current losses and ceasing all further investment have been made, then choosing the former would not be fallacious.

      (also known as: glazier's fallacy)
    </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;The illusion that destruction and money spent in recovery from destruction, is a net-benefit to society.&nbsp;&nbsp;A broader application of this fallacy is the general tendency to overlook opportunity costs or that which is unseen, either in a financial sense or other.

      This fallacy goes far beyond just looking for the silver lining, thinking positive, or making the best of a bad situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the incorrect assumption that the net benefit is positive.

    <p>
      (Also known as: Arnauld's Circle)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Description</span>: The Cartesian Circle is a term used to describe the fallacy of circular reasoning attributed to René Descartes. It highlights a logical flaw in Descartes' argument where he uses the existence of a benevolent God to validate the reliability of clear and distinct perceptions, while simultaneously using these clear and distinct perceptions to prove God's existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Logical Form:</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;1. Descartes claims that clear and distinct perceptions are reliable because God, a non-deceiver, guarantees them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;2. Descartes uses these reliable clear and distinct perceptions to argue for the existence of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Example #1:</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- Scenario: Descartes argues that whatever is perceived clearly and distinctly is true because a benevolent God ensures this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- Explanation: This forms a circular argument because Descartes' proof of God's existence relies on the reliability of clear and distinct perceptions, which in turn is supposed to be guaranteed by God.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Example #2:</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- Scenario: Descartes claims that his knowledge of being a thinking thing depends on the clear knowledge of an existing God.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- Explanation: This argument is circular as it assumes God's existence to validate the clear and distinct perception of oneself as a thinking entity, while simultaneously using this perception to prove God's existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Variation:</span>&#xa0;Circular reasoning can occur in various contexts where the conclusion is assumed in one of the premises. For example, using the Bible to prove God's existence while asserting that God's existence makes the Bible true.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tip:</span>&#xa0;To avoid circular reasoning, ensure that your premises are independently verifiable and do not rely on the conclusion to support them.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Exception:</span>&#xa0;Some philosophers argue that foundational beliefs can be self-evident and do not require external validation, which can make circular reasoning seem less problematic in those contexts.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fun Fact:</span>&#xa0;The term &quot;Cartesian Circle&quot; was first popularized by Descartes' contemporaries, such as Marin Mersenne and Antoine Arnauld, who critiqued his work for this logical flaw.

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Additional Information</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      - Modern Commentators: Some modern philosophers, like Bernard Williams and Harry Frankfurt, have tried to defend Descartes by suggesting different interpretations of his arguments, such as the idea that his goal was to show the reliability of reason rather than to prove conclusions through syllogistic logic.

    <p>
      (also known as: Argumentum e contrario, Argumentum ex contrario, Appeal from the Contrary)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Description</span>: In logic and law, an argumentum e contrario is used to argue that a proposition is correct because it is not disproven by a certain case. It contrasts with analogy, where similarity between cases is used to argue for a certain conclusion. In legal contexts, this argument helps address issues not explicitly covered by existing laws by inferring that if the law does not mention something, it is not intended to be included.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>

    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;1. Law A states that X must do Y.

    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Example #1:</span>

    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- Argument: Therefore, red cars don't have to have blue tires.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- Explanation: The argument is based on the fact that the law specifies green cars but does not mention red cars. Thus, it is inferred that the law does not apply to red cars.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: normal;">Example #2:</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- Scenario: § 456 of the Y-Law says that it's irrelevant whether a message is sent by letter or by telegraph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- Argument: Therefore, messages cannot be sent by fax machines.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- Explanation: This argument incorrectly infers that because the law does not mention faxes, they must be excluded. It misinterprets the law's intent, as fax machines likely did not exist when the law was written.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Variation</span>: Arguments e contrario can vary in their application, especially in legal contexts where the interpretation of the law's intent and the specifics of unmentioned cases can lead to different conclusions. It often contrasts with arguments from analogy.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tip: </span>When using an argumentum e contrario, consider the law's intent and whether the unmentioned case might reasonably be included if the law were updated. Be cautious of overextending the argument to situations the law did not explicitly intend to exclude.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Exception: </span>Argumentum e contrario is not always a fallacy. In some cases, it is a legitimate interpretative tool in law where it is clear that the law deliberately excludes certain cases. However, if the exclusion is not deliberate or clear, the argument can become fallacious.

    </p>
  
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Description: </span>An attack ad is a type of advertisement used in political campaigns to launch personal attacks against an opposing candidate or party to gain support for the attacking candidate. These ads often form part of negative campaigning and are disseminated via mass media, criticizing an opponent's political platform, character, or policy ideas, often using innuendo and opposition research.

    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- Explanation: The ad featured a young girl picking daisy petals, followed by a countdown and a nuclear explosion, implying that Barry Goldwater's aggressive Cold War policies could lead to nuclear war. This ad effectively played on voters' fears and painted Goldwater as a dangerous choice.

    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- Explanation: This ad highlighted a furlough program supported by Michael Dukakis that allegedly allowed a criminal to commit further crimes. The ad suggested that Dukakis was weak on crime, swaying voters by presenting a stark and emotional narrative.

    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Variation:</span>&#xa0;Attack ads can target a candidate's character, policies, or associates, and can range from subtle innuendo to overt accusations. They can appear on television, online platforms, or other media.

    </p>
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Exception:</span>&#xa0;If an attack ad is too personal or perceived as unfair, it can backfire, damaging the reputation of the candidate who sponsored it rather than the intended target.

      (Also known as: Nothing-buttery, Nothing-but-ism)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Description</span>: Greedy reductionism, identified by Daniel Dennett in his 1995 book *Darwin's Dangerous Idea*, is an erroneous form of reductionism. It occurs when scientists and philosophers, in their eagerness to explain phenomena, underestimate complexities and attempt to skip essential layers or levels of theory. This contrasts with &quot;good&quot; reductionism, which methodically explains phenomena in terms of their parts and interactions.

    </p>
  
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Description: </span>The junkyard tornado is an argument against abiogenesis, comparing the probability of life arising by chance to the likelihood of a tornado assembling a Boeing 747 from junkyard debris. Originally posited by English astronomer Fred Hoyle, it argues that the formation of complex life is so improbable that it couldn't happen by random chance alone. This analogy is often used by those rejecting evolutionary theory, despite its flawed assumptions.

    <p>
      -<span style="font-weight: bold;">&#xa0;Description:</span>&#xa0;The mind projection fallacy is an informal fallacy first described by physicist and Bayesian philosopher E. T. Jaynes. It occurs when someone projects their subjective perceptions or ignorance onto the external world, mistakenly believing these mental states to be intrinsic properties of reality. This fallacy has two forms: the positive form, where one's subjective judgments are assumed to be inherent properties of objects, and the negative form, where one's lack of knowledge about a phenomenon is taken to mean the phenomenon is inherently unknowable.

    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Variation:</span>&#xa0;This fallacy can be extended to any situation where subjective experiences or personal ignorance are wrongly attributed as inherent qualities of the external world.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tip: </span>Always differentiate between subjective perceptions and objective reality. Recognize that others may have different perspectives and that a lack of personal understanding does not reflect the nature of reality itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Exception:</span>&#xa0;The mind projection fallacy is not applicable when subjective experiences are clearly recognized as such and not confused with objective properties.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fun Fact:</span>&#xa0;E. T.

    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Description:</span>&#xa0;The psychologist's fallacy is an informal fallacy that occurs when an observer assumes that their own subjective experience reflects the true nature of an event or mental state. Named by William James, the fallacy involves confusing one's own perspective or reaction with the inherent characteristics of the phenomenon being studied. This error can lead to misinterpretation of the mental states or behaviors of others, based on one's own experience.

    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- Explanation: A psychologist feels overwhelmed by stress and assumes that all individuals will react to similar stressful situations in the same way. This fallacy leads to the incorrect assumption that their personal experience of stress is universal.

    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- Scenario: Emotional Responses
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- Explanation: An experimenter who is highly emotional might assume that the participants in their study will have similar emotional responses to stimuli. This may lead to biased conclusions about how different individuals react emotionally.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Variation: </span>The fallacy can also manifest as assuming that others will respond to stimuli or situations in the same way as the observer would, based on personal biases or stereotypes.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tip: </span>Be aware of the difference between personal experience and universal truths. When studying mental states or behaviors, ensure that findings are based on objective data and not solely on one's subjective experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Exception: </span>The fallacy is less likely to occur when the observer acknowledges and controls for their own biases, using rigorous methods to account for subjective differences.

      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Description</span>: The Baconian fallacy is the erroneous belief that historians can derive the &quot;whole truth&quot; about historical events through induction from individual pieces of evidence. This fallacy assumes that by accumulating and analyzing sufficient individual facts or evidence, one can achieve a complete and comprehensive understanding of history. In reality, historians can only aim to gain a partial understanding of historical events due to the limitations in evidence and interpretation.

    </p>
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Variation: </span>The fallacy may also appear in the form of believing that comprehensive knowledge can be achieved by merely aggregating all available evidence without considering the limitations and potential biases in the evidence.

    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Exception: </span>The fallacy is less relevant in cases where historians are explicitly aware of and account for the limitations of their evidence and methods, focusing on well-supported interpretations rather than claiming to uncover the absolute truth.

      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tip:</span>&#xa0;When evaluating historical claims about political parties, consider the historical context and acknowledge that party platforms and ideologies can change over time. Assess claims critically and avoid drawing overly simplistic or misleading conclusions based on selective historical evidence.

    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Exception:</span>&#xa0;The fallacy may be less relevant in discussions where both historical and current party positions are accurately represented and analyzed within the context of evolving political landscapes.

    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fun Fact:</span>&#xa0;The Dixiecrat fallacy is named after the Dixiecrats, a faction of the Democratic Party that opposed civil rights legislation in the mid-20th century. This term highlights the misleading use of historical facts to serve contemporary political arguments.

    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Description</span>: The historical fallacy is a logical error described by philosopher John Dewey. It occurs when someone assumes that the process used to achieve a result was necessary for that result, leading to the belief that the outcome would not have occurred without the specific process. This fallacy involves misattributing the outcome to the process that brought it about, rather than recognizing that the outcome could have happened through other means or by chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Logical Form:</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;1. An outcome is achieved through a specific process.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;2. The outcome is then assumed to be dependent on the exact process used.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;3. The process is incorrectly considered essential to the result, ignoring the possibility of other methods achieving the same outcome.
    </p>

    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- Scenario: Finding a Lost Wallet
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- Explanation: A man loses his wallet and searches for it in a location he suspects it might be. He finds the wallet there and concludes that his initial suspicion about the location was correct and essential for finding it. He fails to consider that the wallet might have been found through other means or by chance.

    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- Scenario: A Successful Experiment
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- Explanation: A scientist conducts an experiment using a particular method and achieves a successful result. The scientist then assumes that the success was solely due to the chosen method, disregarding the possibility that other methods might have also led to the same result.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Variation: </span>The fallacy can also manifest as the assumption that the historical context or specific conditions leading to an outcome were crucial, rather than recognizing the possibility of alternative scenarios or methods.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tip: </span>When evaluating outcomes, consider multiple potential causes or methods, and avoid attributing success solely to the specific process used. Recognize that outcomes may be achieved through various means.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Exception:</span>&#xa0;The historical fallacy may not apply if the process used is unique and cannot be replicated or if it is demonstrated that no other process would have led to the same result.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fun Fact:</span>&#xa0;John Dewey, who described this fallacy, was a prominent American philosopher and educator known for his work on pragmatism and progressive education. His insights into logical errors like the historical fallacy continue to influence critical thinking and analysis.

    <p>
      (Also known as: Missing Dollar Paradox)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Description:</span>&#xa0;The missing dollar riddle is a famous puzzle that involves a logical fallacy by presenting a scenario where a dollar seems to be missing after a series of transactions. It plays on the confusion between different categories of money and how they are accounted for.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Logical Form:</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;1. Three guests check into a hotel and pay a total of $30.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;2. The manager realizes the bill should have been $25 and gives $5 to the bellhop to return to the guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;3. The bellhop decides to keep $2 as a tip and gives $1 back to each guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;4. The guests end up paying $27 ($9 each), and the bellhop keeps $2, which totals $29.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;5. The riddle asks where the missing $1 is, suggesting a discrepancy in the total amount.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Example #1:</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- Scenario: Three guests initially pay $30, but the corrected bill is $25. The bellhop returns $3 and keeps $2 as a tip.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- Explanation: The confusion arises from adding $27 (what the guests effectively paid) to $2 (kept by the bellhop), which wrongly implies it should total $30. In reality, the $27 includes the $2 tip; the correct breakdown is $25 (hotel) + $3 (returned to guests) + $2 (bellhop tip) = $30.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Example #2:</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- Scenario: Consider a modified version where the bill is $10. Guests pay $30, the manager gives $20 to the bellhop to return. The bellhop keeps $2 and gives $6 back to each guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- Explanation: Here, the guests effectively paid $12 ($4 each), and the bellhop kept $2. Adding $12 (paid) and $2 (kept by bellhop) incorrectly leads to $14, whereas the correct sum should be $10 (hotel) + $6 (returned to guests) + $2 (bellhop tip) = $18. This demonstrates that the added amounts are not directly comparable.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Variation: </span>Variants of the riddle may involve different amounts or scenarios, such as using shillings or different numbers of people, but the underlying fallacy remains the same: incorrectly summing amounts that are not directly related.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      -<span style="font-weight: bold;">&#xa0;Tip:</span>&#xa0;To avoid confusion, always account for all categories of money separately. Ensure that any sums of money include all assets and liabilities in the correct context.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Exception: </span>The riddle does not apply if all transactions and amounts are correctly accounted for and reconciled. It specifically targets misunderstandings in the way the total amounts are presented.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fun Fact: </span>The riddle has appeared in various forms in literature and media, including a 1933 mathematical fallacy by Cecil B. Read and adaptations in pop culture, such as in the BBC comedy series &quot;Help&quot; and in Abbott and Costello routines.

    <p>
      (Also known as: Trite Answer, Simplistic Answer)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Description:</span>&#xa0;The term &quot;Sunday school answer&quot; is a pejorative expression used primarily in Evangelical Christianity to describe a simplistic or overly obvious response to a complex question. It refers to answers that are commonly expected in a Sunday school setting, regardless of the specific question being asked. Such answers often include concepts like Jesus, sin, and the cross.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Logical Form:</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;1. A complex or specific question is posed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;2. An overly simplistic or generic answer is given (often a religious reference).
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;3. The answer fails to adequately address the question, leading to criticism.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Example #1:</span>

    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- Explanation: The answer is inappropriate because it does not address the question and relies on a common religious reference rather than a thoughtful response.

    </p>
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Example #2:</span>

    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- Response: Someone replies, &quot;We should just pray and trust in God.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- Explanation: This response is seen as a &quot;Sunday school answer&quot; because it is a simplistic solution to a complex issue, lacking depth and consideration for the nuances of the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Variation:</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- In Mormonism: The term is similarly used within the culture of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) to refer to trite answers that are commonly given in Sunday School classes. Examples include &quot;reading the scriptures,&quot; &quot;praying daily,&quot; and &quot;serving others.&quot; Such responses can be seen as inadequate if they do not genuinely engage with the challenges being discussed.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tip:</span>&#xa0;To avoid providing a &quot;Sunday school answer,&quot; consider the context of the question and provide a more nuanced, thoughtful response that addresses the complexities involved rather than resorting to cliché or overly simplistic answers.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Exception: </span>Not all answers that might be labeled as &quot;Sunday school answers&quot; are invalid. In some cases, simple truths can be effective and appropriate, especially when they resonate with the audience or offer genuine encouragement.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fun Fact:</span>&#xa0;Despite its pejorative connotation, some argue that answers dismissed as &quot;Sunday school answers&quot; are often the most fundamental and truthful solutions to life’s challenges, highlighting the tension between simplicity and depth in addressing complex issues.

      (Also known as: Uniqueness bias, Illusion of Uniqueness)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Description: </span>The false-uniqueness effect is a cognitive bias where individuals perceive their qualities, traits, and behaviors as more unique and exceptional compared to others, even though these attributes are actually quite common. This bias often arises in the context of positive traits or behaviors.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Logical Form:</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;1. Individuals rate their own traits or behaviors as unique or better than average.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;2. They assume that fewer people share these traits or behaviors than is actually the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;3. This overestimation of uniqueness helps maintain or enhance self-esteem.

      &#xa0;&#xa0;- Scenario: A person believes they are an exceptionally safe driver compared to others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- Explanation: Despite statistics showing that most drivers consider themselves safe, this individual thinks their driving habits are more cautious and unique. This belief may enhance their self-esteem, making them feel superior.

      &#xa0;&#xa0;- Scenario: A student thinks they are more diligent in group projects than their peers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- Explanation: The student believes their work ethic is exceptional compared to the average student, even though many others might exhibit similar levels of diligence. This perception helps the student feel better about their contributions.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Variation:</span>&#xa0;The false-uniqueness effect can be contrasted with the false-consensus effect, where individuals overestimate the extent to which their attitudes and behaviors are typical and shared by others. The false-consensus effect typically applies to negative traits or behaviors, while the false-uniqueness effect applies to positive traits.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tip: </span>Be aware of this bias when assessing your own attributes and behaviors. Try to consider a wider perspective and use objective benchmarks to evaluate how common your traits truly are.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Exception:</span>&#xa0;The false-uniqueness effect may be less pronounced when individuals are aware of broad statistics and actual prevalence rates of traits or behaviors. Accurate self-assessment often requires considering empirical data rather than personal perception alone.

    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fun Fact:&#xa0;</span>The term “false-uniqueness effect” was formally introduced by psychologists Suls and Wan in 1987, building on earlier concepts like the “illusion of uniqueness” described by Snyder and Shneckel in 1975.

  </li><li><span style="color: #18898b; font-family: &quot;Liberation Sans&quot;, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; ">Virtuality fallacy</span>
    <p>
      (Also known as: Digital Denial Fallacy)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - Description: The virtuality fallacy is an informal fallacy that occurs when it is asserted that things existing in a virtual context, such as cyberspace, are not real or do not have real effects. This fallacy involves dismissing the impact or reality of virtual phenomena based on their digital nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - Logical Form:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;1. Premise 1: X exists in cyberspace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;2. Premise 2: Cyberspace is virtual.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;3. Conclusion: X (or the effect of X) is not real.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - Example #1:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- Scenario: An individual posts harmful or offensive comments online and dismisses concerns by claiming, &quot;It’s just the internet; it doesn’t really matter.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- Explanation: This example illustrates the virtuality fallacy by assuming that because the comments are made in a virtual space, their impact or harm is not real.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - Example #2:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- Scenario: A person cheats in a video game and justifies their actions by saying, &quot;It’s just a game; it doesn’t have real consequences.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- Explanation: This example reflects the fallacy by downplaying the effects of cheating, such as affecting other players' experiences or the game's integrity, by arguing that the context is virtual and therefore inconsequential.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - Variation: The virtuality fallacy is related to the broader category of fallacies where digital or virtual actions are perceived as having no real-world implications, similar to the &quot;it’s just a joke&quot; fallacy where the impact of an action is minimized based on its context.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - Tip: Recognize that virtual actions and contexts can have tangible effects on individuals and systems. Just because something occurs in a digital space does not mean it lacks real-world significance.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - Exception: The fallacy does not apply in cases where virtual contexts are explicitly understood to have no real-world impact, such as certain fictional scenarios or harmless digital simulations with no real consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - Fun Fact: The concept of the virtuality fallacy is increasingly relevant in discussions about the impact of online behavior, particularly as virtual environments and digital interactions become more integral to daily life and societal norms.

      &#xa0;&#xa0;3. Conclusion: The enemy's actions and character are perceived as entirely negative, justifying hostility and aggression.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - Example #1:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- Scenario: During World War I, Kaiser Wilhelm II was portrayed in Russian media as a villainous figure responsible for the war's devastation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- Explanation: By personalizing the enemy as an evil leader, this portrayal simplified complex geopolitical conflicts into a binary of good versus evil, mobilizing public sentiment against the enemy and justifying continued conflict.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - Example #2:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- Scenario: Propaganda during World War II depicted the Axis powers as barbaric and inhumane, often showing enemy leaders as ruthless and villainous in state-approved media.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- Explanation: This characterization aimed to reinforce the perception of the Axis powers as an existential threat, thus encouraging national unity and resolve against a perceived evil.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - Variation: Demonization can vary from portraying a single leader as evil (e.g., Kaiser Wilhelm II) to dehumanizing entire populations or political groups (e.g., portraying enemy nations as barbaric). It can also manifest in more subtle forms, such as media portrayals that emphasize the enemy's most negative traits while ignoring complexities.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - Tip: Be critical of sources that consistently frame an opponent or group in exclusively negative terms. Consider the motivations behind such portrayals and seek out balanced perspectives to avoid falling into the trap of demonization.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - Exception: While demonization is a common propaganda technique, it is not always effective or applicable in every conflict. In some cases, efforts to humanize or understand the enemy can lead to more constructive dialogue and resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - Fun Fact: The concept of demonizing an enemy is not limited to modern media or politics. Historical records show that even ancient civilizations used similar techniques to mobilize support and justify conflicts, as noted by Thucydides in his accounts of Ancient Greece.

    <p>
      (<strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">Also known as</span></strong>: Groundless Accusation, Unfounded Accusation, False Allegation, False Claim)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - Description: A false accusation is a claim or allegation of wrongdoing that is not true or is unsupported by facts. Such accusations can occur in various contexts, including everyday life, quasi-judicial settings, and formal judicial proceedings. They can result from intentional deceit, misunderstandings, or errors in communication or investigation.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - Logical Form:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;1. Premise 1: X is accused of wrongdoing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;2. Premise 2: There is no factual evidence supporting the wrongdoing or the accusation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;3. Conclusion: The accusation against X is false or unfounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - Example #1:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- Scenario: A person falsely accuses their colleague of theft to avoid reprimand for their own mistakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- Explanation: The accuser's false claim is designed to deflect blame and avoid personal consequences. The absence of evidence and the fact that the alleged theft did not occur reveal the accusation as false.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - Example #2:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- Scenario: During a workplace dispute, an employee falsely accuses another of harassment to gain an advantage in a promotion contest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- Explanation: The accusation is baseless and intended to damage the accused's reputation. It is a strategic move to undermine the accused's standing, rather than a genuine claim of misconduct.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - Variation: False accusations can vary in their nature, including completely false allegations where the event never occurred, false allegations where the event did occur but not involving the accused, and mixed allegations that combine true and false elements. They can also arise from deliberate deceit or unintentional errors.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - Tip: When faced with accusations, verify the evidence and consider the context. Look for corroborating details and be cautious of accusations that seem to serve the accuser's interests or coincide with their personal gain.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - Exception: In cases where false accusations are the result of mental illness or suggestive questioning, the accuser may not be intentionally lying but may be influenced by psychological factors or improper investigative techniques.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - Fun Fact: The term &quot;false accusation&quot; has been the subject of numerous high-profile legal cases and media stories. For instance, the wrongful conviction of Juan Catalan in the mid-2000s, later exonerated by evidence from a television show, highlights how false accusations can dramatically impact lives and lead to significant legal and social consequences.

    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;Simply overusing acronyms is not the problem here; it's the deliberate overuse for the purpose of making people think the speaker is very knowledgeable in this area, or perhaps to use terms the audience is unaware of, making the audience think they need the consulting service more than they thought they did.

      <span style="font-weight: bold;">Explanation:</span>&#xa0;Before you say, “Amen!”, realize that this is a clear case of distinction without a difference.&#xa0;&#xa0;There is absolutely no difference here because the only possible way to read the Bible is through interpretation, in other words, what we think it says.&#xa0;&#xa0;What is being implied here is that one's own interpretation (what he or she thinks the Bible says) is what it really says, and everyone else who has a different interpretation is not really reading the Bible for what it says.

    <strong>Description:</strong>&#xa0;Attempting to support a narrative or argument with facts that don't support the narrative or argument.

      FACT: On average, 150,000 people die every day around the world. It is crazy to panic about a virus that, at its peak, was killing 8,000 people per day. But what else can be expected from a moron like you who rejects facts?
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&#xa0;It is a fact that, on average, 150,000 people die every day around the world. It is also a fact that at its peak in the spring of 2020, the Coronavirus was killing about 8,000 people per day. What hasn't been established is what justifies &quot;panic.&quot; &quot;Panic,&quot; or perhaps more accurately &quot;serious concern,&quot; can be justified in many other ways besides the total number of historical deaths. Given this, it doesn't follow that it is &quot;crazy to panic.&quot; Further, saying or writing &quot;FACT,&quot; followed by an accusation of rejecting the fact, makes this more fallacious than a standard non-sequitur.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Example #2:</strong>&#xa0;In May of 2020, it was common to hear accusations of &quot;anti-science&quot; hurled at people who wanted the country to reopen after being closed due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation: </strong>&quot;Anti-science&quot; is similar to &quot;anti-fact.&quot; There are many facts that point to ways the virus could spread, and reopening the country would unquestionably increase the odds that the virus would spread. Science doesn't make value judgments, however. For example, would an extra X number of deaths per week justify people getting back to work? Science <em>informs</em>&#xa0;political decisions such as these; it doesn't answer them. It can be perfectly consistent to agree with the science (facts) and still reject the argument that we are reopening the country &quot;too soon.&quot;
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Exception:</strong>&#xa0;If there is no accusation of rejecting facts, we might have a non-sequitur, but not a fact-to-fiction fallacy. It is not unreasonable to state a fact such as the 150,000 deaths per day stat, then ask why we are taking the actions we are for just 8000 deaths? These kinds of questions are likely to lead to answers that expose the nuance of the arguments.

      <strong>Tip:</strong>&#xa0;Be careful not to read too much into facts. Our minds tend to “connect the dots” in order to support the narratives we already accept.

      Mom: Watching TV that close will make you go blind, so move back!<br>Jonny: That is B.S., Mom. Sorry, I am not moving.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;The <em>false effect</em>&nbsp;of watching TV too closely is going blind. For the most part, the threat that you will &#x201c;ruin&#x201d; your eyesight is an old wives&#x2019; tale. Almost certainly, nobody is going blind from sitting too close unless they ram their eyes into the protruding knobs. Regardless of the <em>false effect</em>&nbsp;(i.e., blindness), watching TV too closely (the cause) has been shown to have some adverse effects on vision, so concluding that one shouldn&#x2019;t &#x201c;move back&#x201d; from sitting too close is fallacious.

    <p class="Body">

    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      The Church used to claim that giving 10% of your income to the Church will free a child&#x2019;s soul from Limbo into Heaven, so clearly giving money to the Church is a scam!
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;Centuries ago, the Church did accept &#x201c;contributions&#x201d; to get loved ones out of &#x201c;Limbo,&#x201d; and it wasn&#x2019;t until 2007 when the Church made it clear that Limbo was a theory and not an official doctrine of the Church, separating the Church from that belief. As for the argument, the false effect of &#x201c;freeing a child&#x2019;s soul from Limbo&#x201d; does not warrant the conclusion that giving your money to the Church is a scam.

    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;We begin with a causal claim: The presence of police at protests cause an escalation of violence (X apparently causes Y). This is just a claim at this point and has not been established, but because there was an escalation of violence (Y is right), it is concluded that the implied claim (police should not be at protests) is true (therefore, X is right). In reality, we don&#x2019;t know what caused the escalation of violence, so we cannot conclude anything about the claim. In addition, we are assuming we have agreed to the condition:
    </p>
    <p class="Body" style="padding-left: 40px">
      <font color="rgb(52, 73, 94)"><em>If the presence of police at protests cause an escalation of violence, then there should be no presence of police at protests.</em></font>
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      To which we may not want to agree if we reason that the presence of police at protests results in a greater good.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp;It can be difficult to parse the claim that is being said to be wrong or right, in which case the causal link might be what is really being rejected. In our first example, it is fallacious to conclude that there is no reason we shouldn&#x2019;t watch TV close up. We parsed this from &#x201c;Watching TV that close will make you go blind.&#x201d; If one is claiming that the causal claim is what is false after showing the effect to be false, then there is no fallacy.

    <strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;In terms of a fallacious argument, two or more propositions are asserted that cannot both possibly be true.&nbsp;&nbsp;In a more general sense, holding two or more views/beliefs that cannot all be true together.&nbsp;&nbsp;Quotes from Yogi Berra (even if apocryphal) are great examples of fallacies, especially inconsistencies.

      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;I know this requires no explanation, and I don't mean to insult your intelligence, but for consistency's sake, I will explain.&nbsp;&nbsp;If he had said those things, then he said them, which is a contradiction to his claim that he never said them. This is both an <i>internal inconsistency</i>&nbsp;and a <i>logical inconsistency</i>.

      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;Again, I apologize, but here it goes... If &quot;nobody&quot; went there, then it could not possibly be crowded, since &quot;crowded&quot; implies too many people are there.

    <strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;Reasoning that because authorities cannot agree precisely on an issue, no conclusions can be reached at all, and minimizing the credibility of the authorities, as a result.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a form of black and white thinking -- either we know the exact truth, or we know nothing at all.&nbsp;

      Therefore, we can say nothing meaningful about issue X.

    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      My mom says that I should study for at least 2 hours each night, and my dad says just a half hour should be fine.&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither one of them knows what they are talking about, so I should just skip studying altogether.

    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;A disagreement among experts does not mean that both are wrong, the answer is a compromise, or that there is no answer to be known; it simply means that there is disagreement -- that is all we can infer.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Example #2:</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      Scientists cannot agree on the age of the universe.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some say it is 13.7 billion years old, some say it is only about 13 billion years old.&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#x2019;s a difference of almost a billion years!&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be clear that because there is so much disagreement, then the 6000-year-old universe should be carefully considered, as well.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;Scientists who &#x201c;disagree&#x201d; with the estimated age of the universe do so primarily on slightly different interpretations of the same objectively valid dating methods.&nbsp;&nbsp;The difference is fairly minute in terms of percentage.&nbsp;&nbsp;Suggesting 6000 years is valid is one thing, but doing so based on the difference in interpretation from mainstream science is completely fallacious.&nbsp;&nbsp;The differences have no bearing on the truth claim of the argument (the actual age).
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp;When the difference in professional disagreement is critical, it should be carefully examined. For example, if two doctors were debating on what medicine to give a patient, and both were claiming that the other medicine would kill the patient.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Fun Fact:</strong>&nbsp;When experts have very different views on scientific issues, it is very often the case that one or more of them are sharing views outside their realm of professional expertise.

    <strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;Choosing more unreasonable explanations for phenomena over more defensible ones.&nbsp;&nbsp;In judging the validity of hypotheses or conclusions from observation, the scientific method relies upon the <i>Principle of Parsimony</i>, also known as <i>Occam&#x2019;s Razor</i>, which states, <i>all things being equal, the simplest explanation of a phenomenon that requires the fewest assumptions is the preferred explanation until it can be disproved.&nbsp; </i>

    <p class="Body">
      This is very similar to the <i><a href="https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/logicalfallacies/Far-Fetched-Hypothesis" target="fallacy" data-toggle="tooltip" title="" data-original-title="Offering a bizarre (far-fetched) hypothesis as the correct explanation without first ruling out more mundane explanations.">far-fetched hypothesis</a></i>, but the hypotheses are generally more within reason (i.e., no leprechauns involved).

    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      Here is why I think my date never showed up: her father had a heart-attack, and she had to rush him to the hospital.&nbsp;&nbsp;In her state of panic, she forgot her cell phone and while at the hospital she was too concerned about her dad to worry about standing me up.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;While possible, it is not <i>probable</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is much more probable that his date just forgot or has purposely stood him up.&nbsp;&nbsp;People tend to believe in the least probable hypotheses out of desire, emotion, or faith -- not out of reason.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Example #2:</strong>&nbsp;Creationists have written volumes of books explaining how, given some divine intervention, a few broken natural laws, and accepting the <i>inconsistency</i>&nbsp;of nature, it could be possible that the universe is only 6000 years old.&nbsp;&nbsp;Accepting these theories would require the abandonment or radical reformation of virtually every science we have, as well us a new understanding of the term, &#x201c;fact&#x201d;.&nbsp;&nbsp;So either all of that is true, or, the Biblical creation story, like hundreds of others in cultures all around the world, are simply mythology.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;Given the incomprehensible number and severity of the assumptions that would need to be made for creationism to be true, the explanation that the creation story is mythology, by far, is the most economical explanation.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp;This isn't about what might be possible; <i>Occam&#x2019;s Razor</i>&nbsp;is all about probabilities.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Fun Fact:</strong>&nbsp;&#x201c;Plausibility&#x201d; technically means &#x201c;believability,&#x201d; which is highly subjective. A Flat-earther would find the flat-earth theory more plausible than the spherical earth. Clearly, who is making the claim of plausibility, matters.&nbsp;

      (also known as: multiple comparisons, multiplicity, multiple testing problem, the look-elsewhere effect)
    </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;Claiming that unexpected trends that occur through random chance alone in a data set with a large number of variables are meaningful.

    <p class="Body">
      In inductive arguments, there is always a chance that the conclusion might be false, despite the truth of the premises. This is often referred to as &#x201c;confidence level.&#x201d; In any given study or poll, there is a confidence level of less than 100%. If a confidence level is 95%, then one out of 20 similar studies will have a false conclusion. If you make multiple comparisons (either in the same study or compare multiple studies), say 20 or more where there is a 95% confidence level, you are likely to get a false conclusion. This becomes a fallacy when that false conclusion is seen as significant rather than a statistical probability.

      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;What this study did not report, is that over 500 comparisons were done between the two groups, on everything from quality of sleep to what they ate for breakfast the next day.&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of all the comparisons, most were meaningless, thus were discarded&#x2014;but as expected via the law statistics and probability, there were some anomalies, the sleeping position being the most dramatic.&nbsp;

    </p>
    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      FAUX News runs a story about an illegal immigrant who committed a horrible crime. The commentators talk about this case for weeks, expressing outrage about the serious danger illegal immigrants pose to the good people of the United States.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;Violent crime by illegal immigrants is rarer than violent crime committed by U.S. citizens [1]. However, if the narrative a media outlet is trying to sell is that illegal immigrants are dangerous, then they can influence public opinion by inferring that one example of such violence is characteristic of the group. Expressing outrage is a way to make the influence even more effective.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Example #2:</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      The Huffaluf Post runs a story about a Republican who assaulted a Muslim woman and told her to &quot;go back where she came from.&quot; The story is shared millions of times and picked up by other liberal media outlets. Liberals are discussing this story on social media saying how outraged they are at Republicans for their hatred of Muslims.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;People and the media (biased media) tend to associate a physical or social identity to the perpetrator of a crime for the purpose of damaging the group's public perception. Why a &quot;Republican&quot; man? How many Republicans are assaulting Muslim women? How many Democrats are? The data are ignored for the benefit of the narrative being sold.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp;There is no exception. If it is &quot;overextended,&quot; then the problem is being exaggerated, and a group of people is unfairly demonized.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Tip:</strong>&nbsp;Next time you read about a story that makes you feel outraged, direct your outrage to the individuals directly involved in the story. Don't demonize an entire physical or social identity.

      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;When you start looking at data with no expectations, anything goes, and any data due to random, statistical anomalies will stand out as &#x201c;odd&#x201d;.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, the fact that 9 out of 10 kids don&#x2019;t have siblings is outside of the norm, but that is the nature of probability.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you were hypothesizing that most kids don&#x2019;t have siblings, and you found this data, then it would provide more of a reason to do further research in making a more justified conclusion.&nbsp;

    <p class="Body">

      <strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp;If Ron were to say, &#x201c;That is impossible&#x201d;, &#x201c;there is no way you are being visited&#x201d;, or make some other claim that rules out any possibility no matter how remote (or crazy), then Sheila would be in the right to ask him for proof -- as long as she is making a point that he cannot know that for certain, and not actually expecting him to produce proof.

    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;Besides the fact that &quot;smokin' hot&quot; is a subjective evaluation, meaning that the girls could be hot to George but not Derek, Derek is assuming George's evaluation is wrong because of the psychological effect known as the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheerleader_effect">cheerleader effect</a></i>.

        Perhaps the greatest mind in quantum physics, Richard Feynman, once said, &#x201c;I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics,&#x201d; and he is probably right.&nbsp;&nbsp;People recognize that this is perhaps the most bizarre, paradoxical, and incomprehensible area of study, that is also a respectable science.&nbsp;&nbsp;So, if you can manage to connect the truth of your argument to quantum physics, it would be unlikely that there would be many people who know enough about quantum physics to assert that your connection is invalid. Thus your argument gains credibility out of ignorance.

    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;The claim made was that the comments were offensive and demonstrably false (as no research has been able to demonstrate that MAC use leads to having sex with computers), and the reality TV star <i>should not</i>&nbsp;have said those things, yet the &quot;Goose Galaxy&quot; supporters countered with the fact that the reality TV star had the right to say those things; therefore, he <i>should have</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Notice that no claim was made about rights&#x2014;this is a <i>strawman</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The fallacy extends beyond the strawman because the defenders of &quot;Goose Galaxy&quot; are conflating the reality TV star's constitutional rights with the claim that he <i>should</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;have said those things.

    <p>
      (also known as: onus probandi, burden of proof [general concept], burden of proof fallacy, misplaced burden of proof, shifting the burden of proof)
    </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;Making a claim that needs justification, then demanding that the opponent justifies the opposite of the claim. The burden of proof is a legal and philosophical concept with differences in each domain. In everyday debate, the burden of proof typically lies with the person making the claim, but it can also lie with the person denying a well-established fact or theory. Like other non-black and white issues, there are instances where this is clearly fallacious, and those which are not as clear.

      Therefore, Y is true.

      <strong>Example #1:</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      Jack: I have tiny, invisible unicorns living in my anus.

      Jack: Then I do.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;Jack made a claim that requires justification. Nick asked for the evidence, but Jack shifted the burden of proof to Nick. When Nick was unable to refute Jack's (<i><a href="https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/logicalfallacies/Unfalsifiability" target="fallacy" data-toggle="tooltip" title="" data-original-title="Confidently asserting that a theory or hypothesis is true or false even though the theory or hypothesis cannot possibly be contradicted by an observation or the outcome of any physical experiment, usually without strong evidence or good reasons.">unfalsifiable</a></i>) claim, Jack claimed victory.

    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Example #2:</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      Audrey: I am a human being. I am not a cyborg from the future here to destroy humanity.

      Audrey: Get to bed, Freddie. And no more SYFY channel before bed!
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;Audrey is making a claim of common knowledge, perhaps sparked by Fred's suspicions. Fred is asking Audrey to prove the claim when he is the one that should be justifying his objection to the claim of common knowledge.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp;Again, the question of who has the burden of proof is not always as simple as demonstrated in these examples. Often, this is an argument itself.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Tip:</strong>&nbsp;If possible, justify your argument with evidence even if you might not have the burden of proof. The only time you might not want to do this is when it gives credibility to an outrageous accusation or claim.

      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&#xa0;Billions of children don’t starve to death each year -- not even close.&#xa0;&#xa0;If it were close, it might be better categorized as an exaggeration, but this would be more of an attempt to get the audience to accept the assertion as a fact while focusing more on the reason rather than the assertion itself.

      The reason the firmament, a tent-like structure that kept the “waters above” from flooding the earth as described in the Bible, is no longer there today, is because it was destroyed during Noah’s flood.

    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&#xa0;The reason the firmament isn’t there today is because it never existed.&#xa0;&#xa0;To attempt to explain it is to get the audience to assume it existed.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Exception:</strong>&#xa0;If the argument is preceded with a declaration that the phenomenon does occur, then what would be the <i>subverted support </i>is simply a reason given.

    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">

      <strong>Tip: </strong>Exaggeration is a risky technique you want to avoid. On the one hand, it can make your argument more compelling (technically, by misrepresenting the truth). On the other hand, if you are called out for your exaggeration, it will damage the credibility of your argument as well as your own credibility.

      (Also known as: Lump of Jobs Fallacy, Fallacy of Labour Scarcity, Fixed Pie Fallacy, Zero-Sum Fallacy)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      ### Lump of Labour Fallacy
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - Name: Lump of Labour Fallacy
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - Also known as: Lump of Jobs Fallacy, Fallacy of Labour Scarcity, Fixed Pie Fallacy, Zero-Sum Fallacy
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - Description: The lump of labour fallacy is the incorrect belief that there is a fixed amount of work available in an economy. According to this fallacy, if some people work fewer hours or if productivity increases, it will lead to a reduction in the number of jobs or increase in unemployment. This misconception suggests that employment is a zero-sum game, where the gain of one worker is the loss of another.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - Logical Form:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;1. Premise 1: There is a fixed amount of work to be done in the economy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;2. Premise 2: Reducing work hours or increasing productivity leads to fewer jobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;3. Conclusion: Measures such as reducing working hours or increasing immigration will decrease employment or increase unemployment.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - Example #1:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- Scenario: Advocates argue that increasing the minimum wage will lead to higher unemployment because employers will reduce their workforce to offset the increased labor costs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- Explanation: This argument assumes that the total amount of work is fixed, and that higher wages will lead to fewer jobs. In reality, higher wages can increase worker productivity and demand for goods, potentially creating more jobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - Example #2:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- Scenario: Some people claim that allowing more immigrants into the workforce will take jobs away from native-born workers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- Explanation: This view is based on the belief that the number of available jobs is fixed. However, immigrants can increase demand for goods and services, which can lead to the creation of new jobs and economic growth.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - Variation: The fallacy can be applied to various contexts, such as debates over working hours, immigration, and technological advancements. It is also known as the &quot;zero-sum fallacy&quot; because it incorrectly assumes that gains in employment for some result in losses for others.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - Tip: To counter the lump of labour fallacy, consider that economic growth and job creation are not zero-sum. Expanding productivity, technological advancement, and increasing the labor pool can lead to a more dynamic job market with new opportunities.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - Exception: Critics argue that the fallacy does not account for all nuances, such as the real administrative and operational costs associated with changing labor policies or the transitional impacts of technological changes. These factors can sometimes lead to temporary disruptions or adjustments in the job market.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - Fun Fact: The term &quot;lump of labour fallacy&quot; was popularized by economist David Frederick Schloss in 1891. His work aimed to debunk the misconception that the amount of work is fixed, highlighting the dynamic nature of labor markets and economic growth.

    <p>
      ### Referential Theory of Meaning
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Name**: Referential Theory of Meaning
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Also known as**: Direct Reference Theory, Referential Realism
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Description**: A referential theory of meaning posits that the meaning of a word or expression lies in the real-world object it refers to. For instance, the word &quot;tree&quot; points to an actual tree in the world, making the tree its referent. Critics argue that this view is limited as it assumes all words must refer to real objects and overlooks the nuances of language use and context.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;1. Premise 1: The meaning of a word is determined by the object it refers to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;2. Premise 2: Words have meaning only if they point to real-world objects.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;3. Conclusion: The meaning of words resides within the objects they denote.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- **Scenario**: The word &quot;Pegasus&quot; refers to a mythical flying horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- **Explanation**: According to the referential theory, &quot;Pegasus&quot; lacks meaning because it does not refer to a real object. However, in practice, &quot;Pegasus&quot; is understood as a concept from mythology, indicating that meaning can exist without a real referent.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- **Scenario**: The phrase &quot;nobody was in the room.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- **Explanation**: The referential theory would struggle with this phrase, as &quot;nobody&quot; does not refer to a specific object. Nevertheless, the phrase is meaningful in indicating an empty room, showing that meaning can arise from usage and context.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation**: The theory can be contrasted with mediated reference theory, which suggests that meaning is derived through an intermediary sense or description rather than direct reference.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip**: Understand that while referential theory emphasizes the link between words and their real-world counterparts, it is essential to consider the context and use of language, as words can have meaning even without direct referents.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>

      - **Exception**: The theory falls short in explaining abstract, fictional, or non-existent entities, such as &quot;unicorn&quot; or &quot;justice,&quot; which still hold meaning despite lacking a concrete referent.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact**: Philosopher John Stuart Mill, an early advocate of this theory, distinguished between connotation (attributes implied by a term) and denotation (the actual object referred to), contributing significantly to the development of referential theory.

      ### Notable Philosophers
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **John Stuart Mill**: Introduced the distinction between connotation and denotation, arguing that the meaning of terms involves the attributes they imply and the objects they denote.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Bertrand Russell**: Although often associated with mediated reference theory, Russell's views also included elements of direct reference theory, emphasizing the relationship between language and reality.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Saul Kripke**: Defended direct reference theory, particularly for proper names, arguing that names are &quot;rigid designators&quot; that refer to the same object in all possible worlds, regardless of the object's properties or context.

    <p>
      (also known as: argumentum ad consequentiam, appeal to consequences of a belief, argument to the consequences, argument from [the] consequences, appeal to convenience [form of], appeal to utility)
    </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Description:</strong>&#xa0;Concluding that an idea or proposition is true or false because the consequences of it being true or false are desirable or undesirable.&#xa0;&#xa0;The fallacy lies in the fact that the desirability is not related to the truth value of the idea or proposition.&#xa0;&#xa0;This comes in two forms: the positive and negative.&#xa0;

    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Logical Forms: </strong>
    </p>
    <p style="padding-left: 40px">
      <em><span style="color: rgb(52, 73, 94);">X is true because if people did not accept X as being true then there would be negative consequences.</span></em>

      <strong>Example #1 (positive):</strong>
    </p>
    <p style="padding-left: 40px">
      <em><span style="color: rgb(52, 73, 94);">If there is objective morality, then good moral behavior will be rewarded after death.&#xa0;&#xa0;I want to be rewarded; therefore, morality must be objective.</span></em>

    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Example #2 (negative):</strong>
    </p>
    <p style="padding-left: 40px">
      <em><span style="color: rgb(52, 73, 94);">If there is no objective morality, then all the bad people will not be punished for their bad behavior after death.&#xa0;&#xa0;I don’t like that; therefore, morality must be objective.</span></em>
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&#xa0;The fact that one wants to be rewarded, or wants other people to suffer, says nothing to the truth claim of objective morality.&#xa0;&#xa0;These examples are also <i>begging the question</i>&#xa0;&#xa0;that there is life after death.

    <p class="Body" style="padding-left: 40px">
      <em><span style="color: rgb(52, 73, 94);">If there is no freewill, then we are not ultimately in control of our actions. If this is true, our entire system of justice would be seriously flawed. This would be very bad; therefore, freewill must exist.</span></em>
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&#xa0;The “freewill” argument has been around for thousands of years, and we may never know how free we really are to make decisions. Many philosophers recognize this problem as well as the consequences of not believing in freewill. For this reason, some suggest that we should just accept freewill as being true. While acting as if we have freewill might lead to a better outcome, actually believing freewill to be true because of the consequences is a compromise of one’s rational integrity.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Exception:</strong>&#xa0;If the consequences refer to actions taken or not taken, it would be more of a warning than an argument, thus not fallacious.

      <em><span style="color: rgb(52, 73, 94);">If you continue to reflect the sun in my eyes using your watch, I will take your watch and shove it in a place the sun don’t shine. Therefore, you should really stop doing that.</span></em>
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Variation:</strong>&#xa0;The <em>appeal to convenience</em>&#xa0;is accepting an argument because its conclusion is convenient, not necessarily true. This is very similar to the <em>appeal to consequences</em>&#xa0;except that consequences are only positive and reasonably referred to as “convenient.”

    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Tip:</strong>&#xa0;Realize that you can deal with reality, no matter what that reality turns out to be.&#xa0;&#xa0;You don’t need to hide from it—face it and embrace it.

    (also known as: argumentum ad baculum, argument to the cudgel, appeal to the stick, Threat of force)

    <strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;When the desire for something to be true is used in place of/or as evidence for the truthfulness of the claim.&nbsp;&nbsp;Wishful thinking, more as a cognitive bias than a logical fallacy, can also cause one to evaluate evidence very differently based on the desired outcome.

      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;No, you don&#x2019;t know that, and what the heck is your &#x201c;heart of hearts&#x201d; anyway?&nbsp;&nbsp;This is classic <i>wishful thinking</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;-- wanting the home team to win so pretending that it is/has to be true.

    </p>
    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">

    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;The fact that one doesn&#x2019;t like the idea of simply not existing is not evidence for the belief.&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides, nobody seemed to mind the eternity they didn&#x2019;t exist before they were born.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp;When <i>wishful thinking</i>&nbsp;is expressed as a hope, wish, or prayer and no belief is formed as a result, then it is not a fallacy because no direct or indirect argument is being made.
    </p>
    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">

      <strong>Tip:</strong>&nbsp;Wishing for something to be true is a powerful technique when and only when, a) you have influence on what it is you want to be true and b) you take action to make it come true -- not just wish for it to be true.

    <p>
      (also known as: superstitious thinking)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Description: Making causal connections or correlations between two events not based on logic or evidence, but primarily based on superstition.&#xa0;&#xa0;Magical thinking often causes one to experience irrational fear of performing certain acts or having certain thoughts because they assume a correlation with their acts and threatening calamities.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      Logical Form:
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      Event A occurs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Event B occurs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of superstition or magic, event A is causally connected to or correlated with event B.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      Example #1:
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Governor issues a proclamation for the people of his state to pray for rain.&#xa0;&#xa0;Several months later, it rains.&#xa0;&#xa0;Praise the gods!
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      Explanation: Suggesting that appealing to the gods for rain via prayer or dance is just the kind of thing crazy enough to get you elected president of the United States, but there is absolutely no logical reason or evidence to support the claim that appealing to the gods will make it rain.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      Example #2:
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      I refuse to stay on the 13th floor of any hotel because it is bad luck.&#xa0;&#xa0;However, I don’t mind staying on the same floor as long as we call it the 14th floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      Explanation: This demonstrates the kind of magical thinking that so many people engage in, that, according to Dilip Rangnekar of Otis Elevators, an estimated 85% of buildings with elevators did not have a floor numbered “13”.&#xa0;&#xa0;There is zero evidence that the number 13 has any property that causes bad luck -- of course, it is the superstitious mind that connects that number with bad luck.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      Example #3:
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      I knew I should have helped that old lady across the road.&#xa0;&#xa0;Because I didn’t, I have been having bad Karma all day.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      Explanation: This describes how one who believes that they deserve bad fortune, will most likely experience it due to the confirmation bias and other self-fulfilling prophecy-like behavior.&#xa0;&#xa0;Yet there is no logical or rational basis behind the concept of Karma.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      Exception: If you can empirically prove your magic, then you can use your magic to reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      Tip: Magical thinking may be comforting at times, but reality is always what’s true.

    <p>
      (Also known as: Argumentum ab utili, Argument from Utility, Will is More Effective Than Insight)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      ### Will is More Effective Than Insight
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Name**: Will is More Effective Than Insight
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Description**: This technique involves influencing your opponent's will by appealing to their interests and motives, rather than engaging their intellect with logical arguments. It is based on the idea that people are more likely to abandon a viewpoint if they see it as harmful to their interests.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;1. Premise 1: If a belief is contrary to a person's interests, they are likely to abandon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;2. Premise 2: Demonstrate that the opponent's belief is harmful to their interests.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;3. Conclusion: The opponent will abandon their belief.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- **Scenario**: A clergyman defends a philosophical dogma.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- **Explanation**: You point out that the dogma contradicts a fundamental doctrine of his church, making him likely to abandon his defense to avoid conflict with his religious beliefs.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- **Scenario**: A landowner supports the use of machinery in agriculture because it increases efficiency.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- **Explanation**: You suggest that the advancement of steam-powered carriages will depreciate the value of his horses, leading him to reconsider his support for agricultural machinery to protect his financial interests.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation**: This technique can also be applied to sway bystanders who share common interests with you, even if the primary opponent remains unconvinced.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip**: Highlight how the opponent’s belief or stance negatively impacts their personal or shared interests to effectively persuade them to change their viewpoint.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception**: This method is only effective under specific circumstances where the opponent's interests are clearly and directly impacted by their belief.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact**: The Latin phrase &quot;quam temere in nosmet legem sancimus iniquam&quot; translates to &quot;how thoughtlessly we sanction a law unjust to ourselves,&quot; illustrating the self-defeating nature of supporting beliefs contrary to one’s own interests.

      <strong>Example #1: </strong>Tony does not agree that every black person in America should be compensated financially for the history of slavery. Therefore, Tony is a racist.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&#xa0;The term &quot;racist&quot; is an extremely pejorative term that has traditionally been associated with those holding beliefs of racial supremacy—the belief that one's race is superior to other races. By expanding the definition to include &quot;those who don't agree with policies that benefit another race,&quot; we fallaciously equate the behavior with the label's or the group's far more malicious roots. Not only does this unreasonably characterize the person who is against the policy, but it also waters down the meaning of &quot;racist&quot; to the point where traditional racists are unreasonably seen more favorably because the term &quot;racism&quot; has been expanded to include a spectrum of far less malicious behaviors.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Example #2:</strong>&#xa0;Suzie and Patty went on a date. Patty told herself and her friends that she was not going to have sex on the first date, but she did anyway because she was caught up in the moment. The next day, Patty said that Suzie was very seductive, and Patty couldn't resist her advances. Patty's friends convince her that she was raped.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:&#xa0;</strong>Patty's friends' goal was to show sympathy to Patty. They did this by giving her victim status and criminalizing Suzie's behavior by unreasonably viewing Suzie as a &quot;rapist.&quot; Universally, if Suzie's behavior is accepted as &quot;rape,&quot; the definition has radically changed, which not only demeans victims of &quot;traditional&quot; rape by associating them with those who were seduced by their date but conflates actual rapists with those who are just seductive.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Example #3: </strong>Ricardo had a hamburger for lunch. Antonio, Ricardo's vegan friend, argues that he is a murderer.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation: </strong>&quot;Murder&quot; is traditionally defined as the unlawful killing of another human being. A cow isn't a human being, killing a cow isn't unlawful, and Ricardo didn't kill the cow he ate. It is unreasonable to put Ricardo, a guy who at a hamburger, in the same category as Jeffrey Dahmer, a guy who ate his human victims he killed. Antonio is using the term &quot;murderer&quot; in a fallacious attempt to associate a similar level of malice with Ricardo's behavior.

      (Also known as: Undistributed Term Fallacy, Fallacy of the Undistributed Middle Term)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Description:</span>&#xa0;The undistributed middle fallacy occurs in a syllogistic argument where the middle term is not distributed in either of the premises, leading to an invalid conclusion. The middle term, which is supposed to link the two premises, fails to cover its entire class, allowing for logical gaps in the argument.

    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tip:</span>&#xa0;Ensure that the middle term in a syllogism is properly distributed at least once across the premises. For a valid conclusion, the middle term should cover the entire class it represents.

    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      (Also known as: Claim Victory Despite Defeat, Fallacy of non causae ut causae, Impudent Triumph)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - **Description**: This technique involves asserting that you have won an argument or proved a point, even when the evidence or answers provided do not support your conclusion. It relies on the bold proclamation of victory to convince others, particularly if the opponent is not confident or astute enough to challenge the claim.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;1. Premise 1: Your opponent answers several of your questions, none of which support your desired conclusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;2. Premise 2: You declare the desired conclusion as if it logically follows from the discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;3. Conclusion: You assert that you have proved your point.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- **Scenario**: In a debate, you ask your opponent multiple questions about economic policies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- **Explanation**: Although the answers do not favor your stance, you boldly claim that the responses clearly demonstrate your position's superiority and announce your conclusion as if it were a logical outcome of the discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- **Scenario**: During a public discussion, you question your opponent about various social issues.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- **Explanation**: Despite receiving neutral or unrelated answers, you loudly declare that these answers prove your argument, leveraging your assertiveness to make it seem convincing to the audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation**: This technique can also involve misrepresenting or exaggerating the significance of minor points in your favor, presenting them as decisive victories.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip**: Confidence and assertiveness are key. Speak loudly and with conviction to overshadow any logical inconsistencies and to make your proclamation of victory more believable.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception**: This tactic is less effective against well-informed, confident opponents who can easily expose the fallacy. It can also backfire if the audience is discerning and aware of the logical disconnect.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact**: This trick is similar to the fallacy of non causae ut causae, which means &quot;non-cause as cause,&quot; where something that is not the cause is incorrectly presented as the cause.

      (<strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">Also known as</span></strong><span style="font-weight: normal;">:</span>&#xa0;&#xa0;Appeal to Friendship)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - **Description**: This argument leverages the relationship or friendship between individuals to influence the acceptance of a claim or proposition. Rather than relying on logical evidence or reasoning, it appeals to the emotional bond and loyalty inherent in a friendship.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form**:

      - **Example #1**:
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- **Explanation**: Alice is not providing any factual evidence to support her political stance but is instead relying on their friendship to convince Bob to agree with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- **Scenario**: John tells his friend Sarah that she should trust his investment advice because they have known each other since childhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- **Explanation**: John is appealing to their long-standing friendship rather than providing solid financial evidence or reasoning to back up his investment advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation**: This can also appear as asking someone to do a favor or make a decision based on friendship rather than merit or logic. For example, “You should hire me for the job because we’ve been friends since college.”
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip**: To counteract this fallacy, focus on the merits of the argument itself rather than the personal relationship. Ask for evidence and logical reasoning that supports the claim independent of the friendship.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception**: In some situations, personal relationships and trust can play a legitimate role, such as when seeking personal advice or support where subjective judgment is acceptable.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact**: The term &quot;Argumentum ad amicitiam&quot; comes from Latin, where &quot;amicitiam&quot; means &quot;friendship.&quot; This fallacy is often effective in personal contexts but can be seen as manipulative in formal debates or logical discussions.

      - **Description**: This argument draws a conclusion based on the similarity between two or more situations. It posits that because one situation is like another in some respects, the same conclusions can be applied to both.

    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- **Explanation**: The teacher is assuming that the current class is similar enough to the previous one in relevant aspects (such as learning styles or engagement levels) for the same method to be effective.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2**:
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- **Explanation**: The lawyer is drawing a parallel between the two cases, suggesting that the legal principles applied previously should apply again due to the similarities.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation**: Sometimes known as reasoning by analogy, this variation involves drawing parallels between more abstract concepts rather than direct situations. For example, &quot;Just as a gardener must prune a plant for it to grow stronger, a person must face challenges to become resilient.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception**: This type of argument can fail if the similarities are superficial or if there are critical differences between the situations that affect the conclusion. Always scrutinize the depth and relevance of the similarities.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact**: Analogical reasoning, which underlies argumentum a simili, is a fundamental aspect of human cognition and is often used in everyday decision-making as well as scientific reasoning.

    </p>
  
    <p>
      ### Argumentum a fortiori
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Name**: Argumentum a fortiori
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Also known as**: Argument from the stronger reason
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Description**: Argumentum a fortiori is a form of reasoning that asserts if something is true in a stronger or more significant case, it must also be true in a weaker or less significant case. It draws upon existing confidence in a stronger proposition to argue in favor of a second proposition that is even more certain.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;1. Premise 1: Proposition A is true and is a stronger case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;2. Premise 2: Proposition B is a weaker case than Proposition A.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;3. Conclusion: Therefore, Proposition B is also true.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- **Scenario**: If driving 10 mph over the speed limit is punishable by a fine of $50, it can be inferred a fortiori that driving 20 mph over the speed limit is also punishable by a fine of at least $50.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- **Explanation**: Since the punishment applies to a less severe case (10 mph over), it must logically apply to the more severe case (20 mph over).
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- **Scenario**: If a person is dead, then one can, with equal or greater certainty, argue a fortiori that the person is not breathing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- **Explanation**: Being dead is a stronger condition that implies not breathing, thus confirming the weaker condition (not breathing) through the stronger condition (being dead).
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip**: Ensure that the stronger case truly encompasses the weaker case, making the inference logical and undeniable.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception**: The argument fails if the stronger and weaker cases do not share a relevant relationship that makes the inference valid. For example, a characteristic true of a larger quantity does not always apply to a smaller quantity if the relationship is not proportional.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact**: In Jewish law, a fortiori arguments are regularly used under the name &quot;kal va-chomer&quot; (light and heavy), which infers from a lighter case to a heavier case, highlighting the deep historical roots and cross-cultural relevance of this form of reasoning.

    <p>
      - **Variation**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- **A maiore ad minus**: This describes an inference from a greater to a lesser condition. For example, &quot;If a door is big enough for a person two meters high, then a shorter person may also come through.&quot;
    </p>
  </li><li><span style="color: #606060; font-size: 8pt; ">a minori ad maius</span>
    <p>
      - **Variation**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- **A minore ad maius**: This less common variation infers from a lesser to a greater condition. For example, &quot;If a rope can tow a car, it can also tow a truck.&quot;

</li><li><span style="color: #18898b; font-family: &quot;Liberation Sans&quot;, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; ">Argumentum ad exemplum</span>
    <p>
      (Also known as: Argument from example)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - **Description**: Argumentum ad exemplum is a rhetorical strategy where an example is used to illustrate and support a point. This form of argumentation uses specific instances to demonstrate the validity of a general claim or principle.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;1. General Claim: Proposition A is true.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;2. Example: Specific instance B demonstrates Proposition A.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;3. Conclusion: Therefore, Proposition A is supported by the example B.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- **Scenario**: To show that exercise improves mental health, one might cite an example of a study where participants who engaged in regular physical activity reported lower levels of stress and anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- **Explanation**: The specific instance of the study provides concrete evidence to support the general claim that exercise benefits mental health.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- **Scenario**: To argue that renewable energy sources can effectively power a city, one might reference the case of a city that successfully implemented wind and solar power to meet its energy needs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- **Explanation**: The example of the city serves as a real-world illustration that strengthens the argument for the viability of renewable energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- **Analogical Argument**: Uses examples that draw parallels between similar cases to argue that what is true for one case is likely true for another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- **Illustrative Example**: Uses an example purely to clarify a point rather than to prove it.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip**: Choose examples that are highly relevant and representative of the general claim. Ensure that the examples are accurate and verifiable to maintain the argument’s credibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception**: This argument can be weak if the example used is an outlier or not representative of the general claim. Avoid using exceptional cases that might not generalize well.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact**: The use of examples is a common teaching technique in various disciplines, as it helps in concretizing abstract concepts and principles, making them easier to understand and remember.

    <p>
      (Also known as: Argument from dizziness, Appeal to dizziness)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - **Description**: Argumentum ad vertiginem is a fallacious rhetorical strategy that seeks to overwhelm or confuse an opponent with complex, intricate, or convoluted arguments, thereby inducing a sense of dizziness or disorientation in order to win the debate. The idea is to make the argument so difficult to follow that the opponent cannot respond effectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;1. Present a complex and convoluted argument (Proposition A).
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;2. Opponent becomes confused and disoriented by the complexity of Proposition A.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;3. Claim victory based on the opponent's inability to effectively counter Proposition A.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- **Scenario**: During a debate on economic policy, one debater presents a long-winded, highly technical argument filled with jargon and intricate statistical data.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- **Explanation**: The opponent, unable to follow the convoluted argument and lacking the expertise to dissect it, concedes the point or appears ineffective, allowing the original speaker to claim victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- **Scenario**: In a discussion about a legal case, a lawyer presents an elaborate series of legal precedents and complex hypothetical scenarios.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- **Explanation**: The opposing lawyer or judge, overwhelmed by the sheer volume and complexity of the information, may struggle to find a coherent counter-argument, thereby making the original argument seem stronger.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- **Bafflement with Expertise**: Overwhelming the opponent with specialized knowledge or technical details that are beyond their understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- **Information Overload**: Presenting so much information at once that the opponent cannot process it all, leading to confusion and inability to respond.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip**: Be aware of the complexity of your own arguments and aim for clarity. If you find yourself becoming overwhelmed by an argument, request simplification or clarification to avoid being manipulated by this fallacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception**: In fields where detailed and complex arguments are necessary and understood by the audience, such as academic or technical discussions among experts, this approach may not be fallacious but rather expected and appropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact**: The term &quot;vertiginem&quot; comes from the Latin word for dizziness, highlighting the disorienting effect this type of argument aims to produce in its audience or opponent.

    <p>
      (Also known as: Appeal to vanity)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - **Description**: Argumentum ad vanitatem is a fallacy that seeks to win an argument by appealing to the vanity, pride, or self-esteem of the audience or opponent. This strategy involves flattery or praise to make the audience more receptive to the argument being presented.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;1. Compliment the audience or opponent (Proposition A).
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;2. Present an argument (Proposition B).
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;3. Audience or opponent, feeling flattered, is more likely to accept Proposition B.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- **Scenario**: A salesperson says, &quot;You clearly have great taste and an eye for quality. That's why I know you'll appreciate this premium product.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- **Explanation**: The salesperson flatters the customer's sense of taste and quality, making them more inclined to buy the product.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- **Scenario**: During a team meeting, a manager says, &quot;You're one of the most dedicated and hardworking members of our team, so I know you'll agree with my proposal to work extra hours this week.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- **Explanation**: The manager uses flattery to make the employee more likely to agree to work additional hours, appealing to their sense of dedication and hard work.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- **Appeal to Flattery**: Directly complimenting someone's intelligence, skills, or attributes to win them over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- **Appeal to Ego**: Highlighting someone's status or achievements to gain their support.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip**: Recognize when flattery is being used to manipulate your decision-making process. Focus on the merits of the argument rather than how it makes you feel about yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception**: Compliments or praise that are genuine and relevant to the discussion can enhance rapport and cooperation without necessarily being manipulative.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact**: The term &quot;vanitatem&quot; is derived from the Latin word for vanity or emptiness, emphasizing the superficial nature of this type of appeal.

      ### Argumentum ad Superstitionem
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Name**: Argumentum ad Superstitionem
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Also known as**: Appeal to superstition
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Description**: Argumentum ad superstitionem is a fallacy where one 
      uses superstitious beliefs or irrational fears to persuade others to 
      accept a conclusion. This fallacy exploits people's tendencies to 
      believe in supernatural causation or omens to validate an argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;1. Propose a superstitious belief (Proposition A).
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;2. Connect the belief to a desired conclusion (Proposition B).
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;3. Use the fear or respect for the superstition to convince others of 
      Proposition B.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Scenario**: &quot;You shouldn't walk under that ladder. It's bad luck, 
      and you might fail your exams if you do.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Explanation**: The argument connects the act of walking under a 
      ladder with the superstition of bad luck, leveraging fear of failure to 
      dissuade the behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Scenario**: &quot;If we don't follow the tradition of throwing salt 
      over our shoulders, we'll bring misfortune to our business.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Explanation**: This argument uses the superstition about salt and 
      bad luck to influence business practices, implying that failure to 
      comply will result in misfortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Appeal to Omens**: Using signs or omens to justify decisions 
      (e.g., seeing a black cat as a sign to avoid a certain action).
    </p>
  </li><li><span style="color: #18898b; font-family: &quot;Liberation Sans&quot;, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; ">argumentum ad socordiam</span>
    <p>
      (Also known as: Appeal to Laziness)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - **Description**: Argumentum ad socordiam is a fallacy in which one 
      argues for a conclusion based on the avoidance of effort, work, or 
      complexity. This fallacy exploits the tendency to prefer easier, lazier 
      options, even if they are less valid or effective.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;1. Present a situation requiring effort (Proposition A).
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;2. Suggest an easier alternative (Proposition B).
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;3. Argue that Proposition B is preferable because it requires less 
      effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Scenario**: &quot;Why bother reading the whole book when you can just 
      read the summary online?&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Explanation**: This argument suggests that reading a summary is 
      better simply because it requires less effort, ignoring the depth and 
      understanding gained from reading the full book.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Scenario**: &quot;We don't need to implement a new software system; the 
      old one works well enough and changing it would be too much trouble.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Explanation**: Here, the argument favors maintaining the status 
      quo due to the effort involved in change, regardless of the potential 
      benefits of the new system.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Appeal to Convenience**: Arguing that a decision is better because 
      it is more convenient, even if it is not the best option.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Appeal to Simplicity**: Preferring simpler solutions purely 
      because they are easier to understand or implement, not because they are 
      more effective.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip**: Recognize when laziness or convenience is being used to 
      justify decisions and consider whether the easier option truly serves 
      the best interest or just avoids effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception**: There are instances where the simpler or easier option 
      might genuinely be the best choice due to other valid factors such as 
      cost, time, or resource constraints.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact**: The phrase &quot;lazy reasoning&quot; can be used to describe 
      arguments that rely on the avoidance of effort or complexity, similar to 
      the concept of &quot;lazy thinking,&quot; where minimal mental effort is applied.

    <p>
      (Also known as: Appeal to Peace, Appeal to Tranquility)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - **Description**: Argumentum ad quietem is a fallacy where an argument 
      is accepted or promoted not based on its merits but because it leads to 
      peace, quiet, or an end to conflict. This fallacy exploits the desire 
      for harmony and avoidance of confrontation, suggesting that agreeing to 
      the argument will result in a more peaceful or agreeable outcome, 
      regardless of its truthfulness or logical soundness.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;1. Proposition A is controversial or causing conflict.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;2. Accepting Proposition A will lead to peace or an end to conflict.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;3. Therefore, Proposition A should be accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Scenario**: &quot;Let's just agree that the Earth is flat so we can 
      stop arguing and get along.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Explanation**: This argument suggests accepting the false claim 
      that the Earth is flat solely to end the argument and achieve peace, 
      without regard for the overwhelming evidence that the Earth is round.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Scenario**: &quot;We should agree with the new policy change even if 
      it's flawed because it will stop the ongoing disputes among the team.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Explanation**: Here, the argument advocates for accepting a 
      potentially flawed policy to end team disputes, rather than addressing 
      the policy's merits or flaws directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Appeal to Avoidance**: Suggesting that accepting an argument is 
      better because it avoids confrontation or uncomfortable discussions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Appeal to Conformity**: Promoting an argument because conforming 
      to it will result in social harmony.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip**: Evaluate arguments based on their evidence and logical 
      reasoning rather than the desire to avoid conflict or maintain peace. 
      Striving for truth and correctness is essential even if it temporarily 
      leads to disagreement.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception**: In certain contexts, such as mediation or diplomacy, 
      finding common ground to achieve peace might take precedence over 
      debating the absolute truth. However, this should be recognized as a 
      pragmatic choice rather than a logical conclusion about the argument's 
      validity.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact**: The term &quot;Argumentum ad Quietem&quot; is less commonly 
      discussed in formal logic compared to other fallacies, but it is often 
      encountered in everyday life when people prioritize harmony over 
      rigorous debate or truth-seeking.

    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      There is life after death!&nbsp;&nbsp;I once heard this story from my friend&#x2019;s sister, that her maid of honor&#x2019;s niece knew this guy who had a friend who heard from his camp counselor a story where some guy was in a coma and saw his grandparents in a tunnel of light, and they told him the winning lottery numbers!&nbsp;&nbsp;I swear to God it&#x2019;s true!

    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;The validity of the testimony of a coma patient aside, in all likelihood, stories like these are either pure fabrications or exaggerations of some much less interesting story.&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to something called the <i>confirmation bias</i>&nbsp;and the <i><a href="https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/logicalfallacies/Wishful-Thinking" target="fallacy" data-toggle="tooltip" title="" data-original-title="When the desire for something to be true is used in place of/or as evidence for the truthfulness of the claim.

    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp;When you trust the source, and trust that the source is accurately representing the facts, you can at least partially accept the claim, depending on the consequences of accepting or rejecting the claim.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if your best friend told you that her best friend told her about an amazing one day sale at the mall, risking a 10-minute drive to the mall might be justified based on the sources.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Fun Fact:</strong>&nbsp;People are often egregiously wrong in their interpretation of events.&nbsp;&nbsp;As time passes, imagination is confused with actual events.&nbsp;&nbsp;You might be able to trust that your best friend is telling you the truth, but only the truth so far as she recalls from her initial interpretation.

      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;Resumes are a classic example of <i>cherry picking</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;information.&nbsp;&nbsp;A resume can be seen as an argument as to why you are qualified for the job.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most employers are wise enough to know that resumes are one-sided and look for more evidence in the form of interviews and recommendations to make a decision.

      My political candidate gives 10% of his income to the needy, goes to church every Sunday, and volunteers one day a week at a homeless shelter.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, he is honest and morally straight.

      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;What information was left out of the example is that this same candidate gives 10% of his income to needy prostitutes in exchange for services, goes to the bar every Sunday after church (and sometimes before), and only works at the homeless shelter to get clients for his drug dealing business.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp;If the parts of the truth being suppressed do not affect the truth of the conclusion, or can reasonably be assumed, they could be left out of the argument.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, political candidates are not committing this fallacy when they leave out the fact that they will need about 8 hours of sleep each night.

    </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;This is best summed up as &quot;dead men don't tell tales.&quot; In its general form, the survivorship fallacy is basing a conclusion on a limited number of &quot;winner&quot; testimonies due to the fact we cannot or do not hear the testimonies of the losers. This is based on the cognitive bias called the <i>survivorship bias</i>.

    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Logical Form:</strong>

      <strong>Example #1:</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      Let's use the example of automobile accidents since we have relatively good data on these. According to the <a href="http://www.NHTSA.dot.gov" target="linkedpage">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a>, roughly 32,000 people die each year on the roads in the United States. The number of people involved in fatal accidents is roughly double that amount, meaning that about half of the people survive, and half die. Let's say that 80% of people involved in a fatal accident reach out for supernatural help. Given an even distribution among survivors and non survivors this would mean that 25,600 people who reach out for supernatural help die and 25,600 who reach out for supernatural help live to tell about it. Now we need to add in the 20% of survivors who did not reach out for supernatural help that lived: 6,400. So what we end up with is a group of 32,000 survivors, 80% of whom appear to have been saved by supernatural intervention. Of course, dead men don't tell tales, so we forget about the 80% of those who died and reached out for supernatural help and didn't get it. Because of the <i>survivorship bias</i>, we have a radically biased sample that leads to a fallacious conclusion.

      The survivorship bias is used by scammers and con artists who take advantage of the &quot;statistically ignorant&quot; public. One common scam is something I call the &quot;prophetic investor.&quot; The scammer will send an e-mail to a very large group of people (say 10 million) with a claim that they have a perfect track record for picking winning investments. But they tell you not to take their word for it, let them prove it you by picking a stock a day for 7 days in a row that increases in value. Then, they say when you are convinced, call them and invest with them. Here's how the scam works:
    </p>
    <p class="Body uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="display: block; padding-left: 20px; font-style: italic">
      Day 1: Five different stocks are chosen, and each stock is sent to 2 million people as the winning pick. Let's say three of those stocks make money, and two don't. The 4 million people who received the stock pick that lost money are removed from the list (kind of like dying).<br><br>Day 2: Another 5 stocks are chosen. This time, each stock is only sent to the &quot;survivors,&quot; about 1.2 million people each get a new pick. Out of that group, perhaps just two stocks are winners. That means that 2.4 million people got the winning stock: two days in a row! You can see where this is headed...<br><br>...<br><br>Day 7: After the final day of sending, about 100,000 &quot;survivors&quot; remain on the list. These are people who have been sent the winning picks 7 days in a row and are convinced that the &quot;investor&quot; must be legitimate. After all, what are the chances that anyone would pick 7 winning stocks in a row with that much confidence?
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Tip:</strong>&nbsp;Whether someone is selling you investment services or a religion, think about the survivorship bias and how you might be jumping to an inaccurate conclusion.

      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;Let's ignore the gross statistical inaccuracy of this quote for a moment (i.e., 1 out of every 100 or so Syrian refugees is not going to kill you). The actual quantitative data about how many Syrian refugees are likely to be terrorists is some number greater than zero. The downside of letting Syrian refugees in the U.S. can be measured quantitatively, perhaps your risk of getting killed by a terrorist will increase from 3.46 billion to one to 3.4 billion to one. The upside, for the most part, is qualitative, that is, cannot be measured easily. What is a human life worth? How do we measure the suffering of others? Since these cannot easily be measured, we ignore them and conclude that taking in Syrian refugees is a bad decision.

      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;While the numbers on gun violence are alarming, we can't ignore the qualitative benefits of gun ownership. When making a decision, all factors need to be considered, even if they cannot be measured quantitatively.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp;It is possible that certain decisions do not have any qualitative components, or the qualitative components are irrelevant. For example, very often salespeople or high-end stores will attempt to sell us overpriced products or services that we can get elsewhere for 1/2 the price. They might justify their higher prices with &quot;service,&quot; where nobody needs &quot;service&quot; when buying toilet paper.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Tip:</strong>&nbsp;Qualitative factors are often measured with a degree of subjectivity, meaning that one might give different moral weight to an idea based on one's core values. Consider this before being too harsh in your judgment of others' political or religious views.

    <p>
      (Also known as: News Management, Information Control)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - **Description**: Managing the news refers to the deliberate 
      influencing of the presentation and dissemination of information within 
      the news media. This technique is often employed to control the 
      narrative, minimize the impact of negative news, and maintain a 
      favorable public image.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;1. Negative information (Bad News) exists.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;2. Release the information at a time or in a manner that minimizes its 
      impact.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;3. Control the narrative to maintain a favorable public image.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Scenario**: A company discovers a product defect that could harm 
      users. To manage the news, the company releases the information late on 
      a Friday evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Explanation**: Releasing bad news late on a Friday gives 
      journalists less time to cover the story before the weekend, reducing 
      the potential for widespread negative coverage and public backlash.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Scenario**: During a political scandal, a government releases a 
      significant report early to selected officials who are likely to support 
      the administration's narrative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Explanation**: By giving the report early to supportive officials, 
      the government ensures that the initial interpretations and comments in 
      the media are favorable, helping to shape public perception positively 
      before opposing views can be presented.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Staying on Message**: Repeatedly focusing on a specific, favorable 
      narrative while avoiding topics that could lead to negative publicity or 
      difficult questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Information Overload**: Releasing a large volume of information to 
      bury the bad news within a sea of less significant details, making it 
      harder for journalists and the public to find and focus on the negative 
      aspects.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip**: Be critical of the timing and context in which news is 
      released. Consider the possibility of deliberate news management tactics 
      when assessing the significance and truthfulness of information 
      presented.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception**: In crisis management, releasing information in a 
      controlled manner can be necessary to prevent public panic and allow for 
      an organized response. The intent here is not to deceive but to manage 
      the situation effectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact**: The term &quot;news dump&quot; is colloquially used to describe 
      the practice of releasing bad news at a time when it is less likely to 
      attract attention, such as late on a Friday or during a major event.

      Not believing in the literal resurrection of Jesus because the Bible has errors and contradictions, is like denying that the Titanic sank because eye-witnesses did not agree if the ship broke in half before or after it sank.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;This is an actual analogy used by a Christian debater (one who usually appears to value reason and logic).&nbsp;&nbsp;There are several problems with this analogy, including:

    <ul>
      <li>
        The Titanic sank in recent history

      Believing in the literal resurrection of Jesus is like believing in the literal existence of zombies.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;This is a common analogy used by some atheists who argue against Christianity.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a <i>weak analogy</i>&nbsp;because:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Jesus was said to be alive not just undead
      </li>
      <li>
        If God is assumed, then God had a reason to bring Jesus (himself) back&#x2014;no such reason exists for zombies
      </li>
      <li>
        Zombies eat brains, Jesus did not (as far as we know)
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp;It is important to note that analogies cannot be &#x201c;faulty&#x201d; or &#x201c;correct&#x201d;, and even calling them &#x201c;good&#x201d; or &#x201c;bad&#x201d; is not as accurate as referring to them as either &#x201c;weak&#x201d; or &#x201c;strong&#x201d;.&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of an analogy is an argument in itself, the strength of which is very subjective.&nbsp;&nbsp;What is weak to one person, is strong to another.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Tip:</strong>&nbsp;Analogies are very useful, powerful, and persuasive ways to communicate ideas.&nbsp;&nbsp;Use them -- just make them strong.

      Science often gets things wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp;It wasn&#x2019;t until the early 20th century when particle physics came along that scientists realized that the atom wasn&#x2019;t the smallest particle in existence.&nbsp;&nbsp;So perhaps science will soon realize that it is wrong about the age of the universe, the non-existence of a global flood, evolution, and every other science fact that contradicts the Bible when read literally.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;To see this fallacy, let&#x2019;s put it in the logical form, using just the evolution claim:
    </p>
    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      P1. Thinking the atom was the smallest particle was a mistake of science.

    </p>
    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      C. Therefore, science thinking the atom was the smallest particle is like science thinking evolution is true.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      Premise two (P2) should jump out as a bold assumption, although not fallacious.&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember, the premises don&#x2019;t have to be true for the argument to be valid, but if both premises were true, does the conclusion (C) follow?&nbsp;&nbsp;No, because of the <i>extended fallacy</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is if evolution were false it would not be for the same reason that science thought the atom was the smallest particle.&nbsp;&nbsp;Science &#x201c;was wrong&#x201d; in that case because it did not have access to the whole truth due to discoveries yet to be made at the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;If evolution were wrong, then all the discoveries that have been made, the facts that have been established, the foundation of many sciences that have led to countless advances in medicine, would all be dead wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp;This would be a mistake of unimaginable proportions and consequences that would unravel the very core of scientific understanding and inquiry.

      There is no way those Girl Scouts could have sold all those cases of cookies in one hour.&nbsp;&nbsp;If they did, they would have to make $500 in one hour, which, based on an 8 hour day is over a million dollars a year.&nbsp;&nbsp;That is more than most lawyers, doctors, and successful business people make!
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;The Girl Scouts worked just for one hour -- not 40 per week for a year.&nbsp;&nbsp;Suggesting the extreme leads to an absurd conclusion; that Girl Scouts are among the highest paid people in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to mention, there is a whole troop of them doing the work, not just one girl.

    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;It is unlikely that God had mouthwash on his mind when issuing that commandment, but if he did, we&#x2019;re all screwed (at least those of us with fresh breath).

    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp;This fallacy is a misuse of one of the greatest techniques in argumentation, <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>, or reducing the argument to the absurd.&nbsp;&nbsp;The difference is where the absurdity actually is in the argument or in the reasoning of the one trying to show the argument is absurd.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      Here is an example of an argument that is proven false by reducing to the absurd, legitimately.

      <strong>Tip:</strong>&nbsp;People very often say stupid things.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes it is easy to reduce their arguments to absurdity, but remember, in most cases, your goal should be diplomacy, not making the other person look foolish.&nbsp;&nbsp;Especially when dealing with your spouse&#x2014;unless you really like sleeping on the couch.

    <p>
      (also known as: Slothful induction, appeal to luck, appeal to bad luck, appeal to good luck)
    </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Description: </strong>Concluding that a result is due to chance when the evidence strongly suggests otherwise.&nbsp;&nbsp;The <i>appeal to luck</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;variation uses luck in place of coincidence or chance.

      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;Dwight is a trouble-maker -- that is quite clear.&nbsp;&nbsp;Rather than face the facts, he is <i>appealing to</i>&nbsp;<i>coincidence </i>by suggesting he just gets caught more often due to bad timing.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp;Coincidences do happen.&nbsp;&nbsp;When the evidence points in the direction of coincidence, the coincidence might be the best option.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Tip:</strong>&nbsp;Remember that million-to-one thing happened to you? It was probably a coincidence. Given how many things happen to us every day, all of us should experience many million-to-one events throughout our lifetimes.

    <strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;A generalization that is technically accurate, but has one or more qualifications which eliminate so many cases that the resulting argument is significantly weaker than the arguer implies.&nbsp;&nbsp;In many cases, the listed exceptions are given in place of evidence or support for the claim, not in addition to evidence or support for the claim.

    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;We have many reasons supporting the opposite claim -- that this country is in great shape still, or at least that it is not in <i>terrible</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;shape.&nbsp;&nbsp;By the time all the reasons are listed, the original claim of our country being in terrible shape is a lot less agreeable.

      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;It is extremely unreasonable (and dangerous) to draw a universal conclusion about the health risks of smoking by the case study of one man.

      Four out of five dentists recommend Happy Glossy Smiley toothpaste brand.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, it must be great.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;It turns out that only five dentists were actually asked.&nbsp;&nbsp;When a random sampling of 1000 dentists was polled, only 20% actually recommended the brand.&nbsp;&nbsp;The four out of five result was not necessarily a <i><a href="https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/logicalfallacies/Biased-Sample-Fallacy" target="fallacy" data-toggle="tooltip" title="" data-original-title="Drawing a conclusion about a population based on a sample that is biased, or chosen in order to make it appear the population on average is different than it actually is.">biased sample</a></i>&nbsp;or a dishonest survey; it just happened to be a statistical anomaly common among small samples.

      <strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp;When statistics of a larger population are not available, and a decision must be made or opinion formed if the small sample size is all you have to work with, then it is better than nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if you are strolling in the desert with a friend, and he goes to pet a cute snake, gets bitten, then dies instantly, it would not be fallacious to assume the snake is poisonous.

    <p>
      - **Description**: In the context of argumentation and debate, labeling 
      is used as a &quot;red herring&quot; to divert attention from the actual argument. 
      This tactic involves dismissing an argument or debater by associating 
      them with an emotionally charged label, often negatively. It constitutes 
      an informal fallacy by discrediting or accrediting a position without 
      valid reasoning.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;1. Person A makes claim X.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;2. Person B labels Person A or claim X with a charged term Y.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;3. Therefore, claim X is dismissed or accepted based on term Y rather 
      than its merit.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Scenario**: &quot;Jones believes that it can be done with the right 
      technology.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Labeling**: &quot;Jones is a deluded fool.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Explanation**: The argument is dismissed by attacking Jones 
      personally, labeling him as deluded, instead of addressing the 
      feasibility of the technology.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Scenario**: &quot;The witness claims to have seen something that 
      indicates foul play.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Labeling**: &quot;It is paranoid to assume foul play.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Explanation**: The witness's observation is dismissed by labeling 
      the assumption of foul play as paranoid, diverting attention from the 
      potential validity of the claim.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Positive Labeling**: Attempting to gain sympathy or credibility by 
      associating a debater or position with positive labels, such as 
      authoritative or noble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Example: &quot;It has been suggested that something in the book could 
      be wrong.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Positive Labeling: &quot;It is a very noble book.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Explanation: The suggestion of error is dismissed by emphasizing 
      the book's nobility.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip**: Focus on the actual argument and evidence presented rather 
      than the labels or personal attacks used. Evaluate claims based on their 
      merits and logical coherence.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception**: In some cases, highlighting a debater's qualifications 
      or expertise can be relevant to assessing their credibility. However, it 
      should not replace the evaluation of the argument itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact**: The term &quot;red herring&quot; originates from the practice of 
      dragging a smoked herring across the ground to distract hunting dogs 
      from the scent they were following, illustrating how labeling can 
      distract from the core argument.

      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Description:</span>&#xa0;The fallacy of ex-post-facto statistics occurs when probability laws or statistical reasoning are applied to past events to suggest that the outcome was influenced by some special or supernatural force.

    <p>
      (Also known as: Semantic Stop-Sign, Thought-Stopper, Bumper Sticker 
      Logic, Cliché Thinking)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - **Description**: A thought-terminating cliché is a form of loaded 
      language used to end an argument and quell cognitive dissonance by 
      stopping further discussion. Often passing as folk wisdom, these clichés 
      are designed to dismiss dissent or justify fallacious logic without 
      addressing the argument itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;1. Person A makes claim X.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;2. Person B responds with thought-terminating cliché Y.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;3. Therefore, claim X is dismissed or the debate is ended without 
      further discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Scenario**: &quot;Jones believes that it can be done with the right 
      technology.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Cliché**: &quot;Jones is a deluded fool.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Explanation**: The argument is dismissed by attacking Jones 
      personally rather than addressing the feasibility of the technology.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Scenario**: &quot;The witness claims to have seen something that 
      indicates foul play.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Cliché**: &quot;It is paranoid to assume foul play.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Explanation**: The witness's observation is dismissed by labeling 
      the assumption of foul play as paranoid, diverting attention from the 
      potential validity of the claim.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Positive Labeling**: Attempting to gain sympathy or credibility by 
      associating a debater or position with positive labels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Example: &quot;It has been suggested that something in the book could 
      be wrong.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Positive Labeling: &quot;It is a very noble book.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Explanation: The suggestion of error is dismissed by emphasizing 
      the book's nobility.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip**: Recognize thought-terminating clichés by their tendency to 
      end discussion abruptly. Challenge these clichés by asking for evidence 
      or a more detailed explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception**: Phrases that are backed by evidence or strong claims 
      may not function as thought-terminating clichés.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact**: The term was popularized by Robert Jay Lifton in his 
      1961 book &quot;Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism,&quot; where he 
      described it as &quot;the language of non-thought.&quot;

    <p>
      (also known as: Deceptive Sharing)
    </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;Sharing an article, post, or meme on social media with 
    the intent to influence public perception to perceive a statistically rare 
    event as a common event. The cognitive bias behind this fallacy is the <em>availability 
    heuristic</em>&nbsp;that causes us to have a skewed perception of reality based 
    on specific examples that easily come to mind.

    <p class="Body">
      Like most fallacies, we have the fallacious tactic by the one who shares 
      an article, post, or meme on social media depicting a statistically rare 
      event with the intent to manipulate public perception of the event as a 
      common event. Someone who views an article, post, or meme on social 
      media depicting a statistically rare event and believes it to be a 
      common event, has been a victim of <em>deceptive sharing</em>&nbsp;and is using 
      fallacious reasoning. It is also possible for those sharing content to 
      be deceived, themselves.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      There is a strong, implied argument with the share that the event is far 
      more common than it actually is. If the content is shared with an 
      explicit argument claiming that the event is more common than it really 
      is, then there is no fallacy; it is a factual error. What makes this 
      fallacious is the implied argument that remains unsaid but clearly 
      implied.

      <strong>Example #1: </strong>During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was much debate on 
      reopening schools. Like with many issues, there was a strong partisan 
      split where liberals were mostly against sending kids back to school, 
      and conservatives were mostly for sending kids back to school. Several 
      of my liberal friends commonly shared stories about kids getting sick, 
      including this story posted with no comment nor argument:

    <p class="Body">
      The strategy is to let those who comment make the arguments that the one

    <p class="Body">
      Children, especially healthy children with no underlying health 
      conditions, dying from COVID-19 is extremely rare. Sharing stories of 
      this happening gives people the impression that it is far more common

      poor understanding of the data.

    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Example #2:</strong>&nbsp;Some people who were adamantly against wearing masks

      with the headline “Two Boys Drop Dead in China While Wearing Masks 
      During Gym Class.” Ignoring the problem with causation (i.e., it has not 
      been determined that the masks had anything to do with the deaths), the 
      purpose for sharing the article is very clear: To attempt to vindicate 
      the sharer’s anti-mask-wearing position. The fact is, recorded instances 
      of people dying from wearing masks are exceptionally rare.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp;It may be the case that statistically rare events are 
      also “feel good” events that have no manipulative intent, for example, 
      sharing a story about a local child who saved his family from a gas 
      leak. There is no implication here that kids saving their families from 
      gas leaks is a common occurrence.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      A more questionable exception is the statistically rare, “feel good” 
      event that may be shared with the intent to manipulate. An example is 
      FOX News, with their regular posts of “hero cops” who save babies, help 
      old ladies across the street, or save the world from intergalactic 
      invaders. The manipulative intent is debatable. While the public does 
      love these stories, they also counter the police brutality stories 
      commonly posted by mainstream media.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Tip:</strong>&nbsp;Remember the <em>principle of charity</em>. If you are not 
      confident that the sharer is implying that the event they are sharing is 
      far more common than reality dictates, ask, “what is the reason you are 
      sharing this?”

      ### Blind Men and an Elephant
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Name**: Blind Men and an Elephant
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Also known as**: The Blind Men and the Elephant
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Description**: This is a parable that illustrates how different 
      people can have different perspectives on the same reality, often 
      leading to incomplete or contradictory conclusions. Each person 
      describes only part of the elephant, not realizing it's part of a larger 
      whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;1. Different individuals observe a complex situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;2. Each individual provides a limited perspective based on their own 
      experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;3. The collective perspectives are incomplete or contradictory but 
      together form a complete understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Scenario**: Several people are asked to describe a large object in 
      a dark room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Perspective 1**: One person touches the trunk and says, &quot;It's like 
      a snake.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Perspective 2**: Another person touches the leg and says, &quot;It's 
      like a tree trunk.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Explanation**: Each person describes the elephant based on the 
      part they touch, leading to different and incomplete descriptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Scenario**: Different departments in a company are asked to 
      evaluate a new software.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Perspective 1**: The IT department says, &quot;It's complex and 
      requires a lot of resources.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Perspective 2**: The user department says, &quot;It's user-friendly and 
      increases productivity.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Explanation**: Each department focuses on their specific 
      interaction with the software, leading to differing views that together 
      provide a fuller picture of the software's impact.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Cultural Interpretations**: Different cultures may interpret the 
      parable in various ways, emphasizing different morals or lessons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Example: Some may use it to teach the importance of collaboration, 
      while others may focus on the limitations of individual perception.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip**: When encountering different perspectives, consider that each 
      may hold part of the truth. Strive to integrate these perspectives to 
      gain a comprehensive understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception**: If all observers are blind to the same crucial aspects 
      or there is significant misinformation, their combined perspectives may 
      still not lead to a correct or complete understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact**: The story of the blind men and the elephant originated 
      in ancient India and has been used in various philosophical and 
      religious texts, including Jain, Buddhist, and Hindu traditions, to 
      illustrate the limitations of human perception and the importance of 
      holistic understanding.

    <p>
      (Also known as: Myside Bias)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - **Description**: Confirmation bias is the tendency to search for, 
      interpret, favor, and recall information in a way that confirms one's 
      preexisting beliefs or hypotheses, while giving disproportionately less 
      consideration to alternative possibilities. This cognitive bias can lead 
      to statistical errors and poor decision-making.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;1. Person holds belief X.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;2. Person encounters evidence or information.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;3. Person favors evidence that supports belief X and dismisses or 
      underweights evidence against belief X.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Scenario**: A person believes that left-handed people are more 
      creative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Observation**: They meet two left-handed people who are artists.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Explanation**: They take this as strong evidence supporting their 
      belief while ignoring the many right-handed creative individuals they 
      know.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Scenario**: A person believes that a particular stock is a good 
      investment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Observation**: They focus on news articles that predict the 
      stock's rise and ignore reports warning about potential declines.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Explanation**: The person only acknowledges information that 
      aligns with their positive outlook on the stock, leading to a biased 
      assessment of the investment.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Selection Bias**: This occurs when individuals only look for 
      evidence in places where they expect to find it, thereby reinforcing 
      their existing beliefs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Belief Perseverance**: The tendency to maintain beliefs even after 
      the evidence supporting them has been discredited.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip**: To mitigate confirmation bias, actively seek out and consider 
      evidence that challenges your beliefs. Engage with diverse perspectives 
      and critically evaluate all information.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception**: Confirmation bias may be less prevalent in situations 
      where individuals have strong incentives to be accurate and objective, 
      such as in scientific research with peer review and replication.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact**: The term &quot;confirmation bias&quot; was coined by English 
      psychologist Peter Wason in his 1960 paper &quot;On the failure to eliminate 
      hypotheses in a conceptual task.&quot; His experiments demonstrated that 
      people tend to seek confirmatory evidence for their hypotheses rather 
      than attempting to falsify them, which is a more robust method of 
      testing validity.
    </p>
  <ul>
<li><span style="color: #606060; font-size: 8pt; ">Motivated reasoning</span>
    <p>
      (Also known as: Desire-Driven Reasoning)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - **Description**: Motivational reasoning bias is the tendency to use 
      emotional desires and preferences to influence one's reasoning and 
      judgment. This bias causes individuals to rationalize or distort 
      evidence in a way that aligns with their wishes, goals, or motivations, 
      rather than objectively evaluating the facts.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;1. Person has a strong desire or motivation to believe in a certain 
      outcome or idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;2. Person processes information in a way that supports this desired 
      outcome or idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;3. Evidence that contradicts the desired outcome is minimized or 
      ignored.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Scenario**: An investor strongly wants a particular stock to 
      perform well because they have a large investment in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Observation**: Despite emerging negative reports about the 
      company, the investor focuses on any positive news and dismisses the 
      negative information.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Explanation**: The investor’s desire for the stock to succeed 
      influences them to selectively interpret information, favoring data that 
      aligns with their hope for a profitable return.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Scenario**: A person is determined to prove that their preferred 
      political party has the best policies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Observation**: They highlight and share favorable statistics and 
      success stories related to their party while ignoring or discrediting 
      similar evidence from the opposing party.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Explanation**: Their motivation to support their party leads to 
      biased reasoning, where only information that aligns with their 
      preferred viewpoint is considered credible.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Wishful Thinking**: A subset of motivational reasoning where 
      individuals believe in outcomes because they desire them, without regard 
      for actual evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Self-Serving Bias**: When individuals interpret information in a 
      way that benefits their self-esteem or personal interests, which can 
      overlap with motivational reasoning.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip**: To counteract motivational reasoning bias, strive to adopt a 
      critical thinking approach and seek out information from a range of 
      sources, especially those that challenge your preexisting beliefs or 
      desires.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception**: Motivational reasoning bias can be reduced in contexts 
      where individuals are trained to use objective criteria and 
      evidence-based decision-making processes, such as in scientific research 
      or high-stakes professional evaluations.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact**: Motivational reasoning bias is not limited to personal 
      desires; it can also occur in group settings where the collective goals 
      or interests of a group influence the way its members process 
      information. For instance, fans of a sports team might irrationally 
      dismiss evidence of the team's poor performance as they strongly desire 
      the team to win.

</li><li><span style="color: #18898b; font-family: &quot;Liberation Sans&quot;, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; ">Counterinduction</span>
    <p>
      (Also known as: Inductive Counterargument)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - **Description**: Counterinduction is a form of reasoning used to argue 
      against an inductive generalization by suggesting that if the 
      generalization were true, then the opposite or contrary case should also 
      be true, but it is not. Essentially, it challenges the validity of an 
      inductive conclusion by highlighting a counterexample or contradiction 
      that undermines the general pattern being presented.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;1. An inductive generalization is made based on a pattern observed in 
      several cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;2. A counterexample is presented that contradicts the generalization.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;3. The presence of the counterexample suggests that the original 
      generalization may be flawed or not universally applicable.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Scenario**: An inductive generalization claims that &quot;All swans are 
      white&quot; based on numerous observations of white swans.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Counterinductive Argument**: A black swan is discovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Explanation**: The existence of the black swan contradicts the 
      generalization that all swans are white, showing that the original 
      inductive conclusion is not universally true.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Scenario**: A study suggests that &quot;Eating carrots improves night 
      vision&quot; based on observations of individuals who improved their night 
      vision after consuming carrots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Counterinductive Argument**: An individual who eats a large amount 
      of carrots but shows no improvement in night vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Explanation**: This counterexample challenges the generalization 
      that eating carrots universally improves night vision, indicating that 
      the relationship may not be as straightforward as initially believed.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Direct Counterexample**: Providing a specific example that 
      directly contradicts the inductive generalization.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Counterexample-Based Refutation**: Using multiple counterexamples 
      to argue against a broader inductive claim.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip**: When using counterinduction, ensure that the counterexample 
      is relevant and robust enough to genuinely challenge the generalization. 
      A single, isolated counterexample may not be sufficient to refute a 
      well-supported inductive argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception**: In some cases, a counterinductive argument may not 
      fully disprove an inductive generalization but rather suggests that the 
      generalization may have exceptions or require refinement.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact**: The term &quot;counterinduction&quot; is not as commonly used in 
      everyday language as &quot;counterexample,&quot; but both concepts are integral to 
      critical thinking and evaluating the strength of inductive arguments in 
      various fields, including science and philosophy.

    <p>
      (Also known as: Aggregation Bias, Group Fallacy)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - **Description**: Group attribution error occurs when individuals 
      ascribe the characteristics, behaviors, or traits of a group to all its 
      members. This cognitive bias involves assuming that what is true for the 
      group as a whole must also be true for each individual within that group.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;1. A group is observed to exhibit a certain trait or behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;2. An individual is then assumed to possess the same trait or exhibit 
      the same behavior based on their membership in that group.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;3. This generalization is made without considering individual 
      differences within the group.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Scenario**: A company has a reputation for having aggressive sales 
      tactics.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Group Attribution Error**: Assuming that every employee in the 
      company is aggressive in their sales approach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Explanation**: The behavior of some members of the company does 
      not necessarily reflect the behavior of every individual. Assuming all 
      employees are aggressive because of the company's reputation is an error 
      in attributing the group's trait to each member.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Scenario**: A particular ethnic group is often portrayed in the 
      media as being highly entrepreneurial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Group Attribution Error**: Concluding that every person from that 
      ethnic group is likely to be entrepreneurial.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Explanation**: Media portrayals and stereotypes do not account for 
      the diversity of individuals within the group. Not every member of the 
      ethnic group will necessarily fit the entrepreneurial stereotype.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Stereotyping**: A broader concept where generalizations about a 
      group’s characteristics are applied to all its members.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Homogenization**: Treating diverse individuals within a group as 
      if they were uniform in their traits and behaviors.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip**: Be cautious about making generalizations based on group 
      characteristics. Always consider individual differences and avoid 
      assuming that traits or behaviors observed in a group apply universally 
      to all its members.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception**: The group attribution error might be less pronounced 
      when there is substantial evidence that the group as a whole 
      consistently exhibits certain traits or behaviors. However, even in such 
      cases, it’s important to avoid overgeneralizing to individuals.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact**: Group attribution error is a common bias in social 
      psychology and can contribute to various forms of prejudice and 
      discrimination. Recognizing this bias helps in fostering more accurate 
      and fair assessments of individuals within any group.

    <p>
      (also known as: statistical fallacy/fallacies, misunderstanding the nature of statistics [form of], fallacy of curve fitting, the fallacy of overfitting)
    </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Description:</strong>&#xa0;This can be seen as an entire class of fallacies that result in presenting statistical data in a very biased way, and of course, interpreting statistics without questioning the methods behind collecting and presenting the data.

    <p class="Body">
      The many methods are outside the scope of this book, but if you really want to jump in here, and see how deceptive statistics can be, get the book, <i>How to Lie with Statistics</i>&#xa0;by Darrell Huff, a 1954 classic that is just as relevant today as it was in his time.

      Did you see that bar graph in USA Today?&#xa0;&#xa0;It showed a HUGE spike in the moral decline of our country!
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&#xa0;The first question that should immediately come to mind is, how on earth can one measure morality?&#xa0;&#xa0;With such a loose definition, it is not hard to imagine one collecting and measuring the data that only supports her desired outcome for the “numbers”.&#xa0;&#xa0;Furthermore, what is a “huge spike?”&#xa0;&#xa0;Visually, you can play with graphs to make numbers seem much more dramatic by not starting at zero, or by doing that little “chopped section” thing.&#xa0;&#xa0;For example, let’s accept that last year 20% of all people were immoral.&#xa0;&#xa0;This year it is 22%.&#xa0;&#xa0;Not a big deal, and if shown on a graph with a vertical axis of 0% to 100%, the line connecting the 20% to the 22% would be barely inclined.&#xa0;&#xa0;However, if shown on a graph with a vertical axis of 20% to 25%, the line connecting the 20% to the 22% would appear to be a huge spike. The same data, a very different presentation.

      Looking at that pie chart, there is a very small percentage of people who declare themselves atheist.&#xa0;&#xa0;Therefore, atheism is not that popular of a belief.

    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&#xa0;First, atheism is better described as a lack of belief.&#xa0;&#xa0;Second, many non-believers are not even familiar with the term “atheist,” and often consider themselves Christian, Jewish, or some other religion, based on their culture and family tradition, not necessarily their beliefs.&#xa0;&#xa0;Statistics don’t account for this.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Exception:</strong>&#xa0;At times, careful and honest explanations of the data and the presentation can help one avoid statistical fallacies, but like virtually all exceptions, this can be debatable.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Variation:</strong>&#xa0;<i>Misunderstanding the nature of statistics</i>&#xa0;is related to this fallacy, but the fallacy rests on the person interpreting the statistics.&#xa0;&#xa0;For example, you might be very troubled to find out that your doctor graduated in the bottom half of her class, but that is half of all the doctors in the world, and to be expected.

    <p http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Description:</span>&#xa0;The fallacy of damning the alternatives occurs when one argues that a particular option is the best by highlighting the flaws of other, often unexamined, alternatives. This approach is flawed because it does not genuinely evaluate the merits of the option in question but instead focuses on disparaging other options. It is particularly fallacious when the alternatives are not fixed or known.

  <p>
    <strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;When an attempt is made to apply a general rule to all situations when clearly there are exceptions to the rule.

      Explanation: “French people are great at kissing” is a stereotype, and

      Exception: Statistical data can reveal properties of a group that are 
      more common than in other groups, which can affect the probability of 
      any individual member of the group having that property, but we can 
      never assume that all members of the group have that property.

      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;I included three examples that demonstrate this fallacy from the very obvious to the less obvious, but equally as flawed.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first example, it is obvious because weight is cumulative.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the second example, we know that water is wet, but we only experience the property of wetness when the molecules are combined and in large scale.&nbsp;&nbsp;This introduces the concept of <i>emergent properties</i>, which when ignored, tends to promote <i><a href="https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/logicalfallacies/Magical-Thinking" target="fallacy" data-toggle="tooltip" title="" data-original-title="Making causal connections or correlations between two events not based on logic or evidence, but primarily based on superstition.

    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp;If the whole is very close to the similarity of the parts, then more assumptions can be made from the parts to the whole.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if we open a small bag of potato chips and discover that the first one is delicious, it is not fallacious to conclude that the whole snack (all the chips, minus the bag) will be just as delicious, but we cannot say the same for one of those giant family size bags because most of us would be hurling after about 10 minutes of our chip-eating frenzy.

      His house is about half the size of most houses in the neighborhood. Therefore, his doors must all be about 3 1/2 feet high.

    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;The size of one&#x2019;s house almost certainly does not mean that the doors will be smaller, especially by the same proportions.&nbsp;&nbsp;The size of the whole (the house) is not directly related to the size of every part of the house.

      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;While it is possible that the 102-year-old granny is guilty for some things, like being way too liberal with her perfume, she would not be guilty in any sex scandals just by her association with the Church alone. Granted, it can be argued that Granny&#x2019;s financial support of the Church makes her morally complicit, but it is clear her &#x201c;crimes&#x201d; are in a different category than those behind the cover-ups.

    <p>
      (also known as: ecological inference fallacy)
    </p>
  
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;The interpretation of statistical data where inferences about the nature of individuals are deduced from inference for the group to which those individuals belong.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Logical Form:</strong>

      Men score better on math than women do. Jerry is a man. Therefore, Jerry is better at math than Sylvia, who is a woman.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;The fact that men score better on math than women is a group generalization. This does not mean that any individual man will score better than any individual woman on math. Educated guesses could be made if we knew more about the statistics. For example, if we just knew that men scored an average of 8% higher than women, we could not even say that any given man is likely to be better at math than any given woman. This is because there could be what is referred to as an uneven distribution, that is, there could be a small group of women who are really bad at math or a small group of men who are really good at math that throws off the curve.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Example #2:</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      A study was done recently showing that church attendance was positively correlated with marriage longevity, that is, those couples who attended church together more often were more likely to stay married. This really should not be a surprise considering the general view of divorce within religion. <strong>What this does not mean is that any given couple who does not attend church is more likely to get divorced than any given couple that does attend church.</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;To make this claim, we would need more information on the raw data used. Perhaps just religious fanatics who go to church daily have a practically non-existent divorce rate of say 2%. Then it is possible that those who never go to church have a lower divorce rate than those who do go to church every Sunday, but because of the fanatics, the distribution is not evenly distributed.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp;It is not unreasonable to make a probabilistic claim about any given member of a group if the data warrants such a claim. For example, if 999 jellybeans in a jar are red and one is green, we can say that any given jellybean in the jar is &nbsp;99.9% likely to be red.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Fun Fact:</strong>&nbsp;Although this is a statistical fallacy, it is commonly extended to everyday situations. If you don't mind getting into statistics a bit, understanding statistical fallacies could improve one's overall reasoning ability.

      The Bible is the Word of God because God tells us it is... in the Bible.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;This is a very serious circular argument on which many people base their entire lives. The circularity is in the stated or implied claim that the reason they trust in the Bible is because it is the Word of God.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is like getting an e-mail from a Nigerian prince, offering to give you his billion dollar fortune -- but only after you wire him a &#x201c;good will&#x201d; offering of $50,000.&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, you are skeptical until you read the final line in the e-mail that reads <i>&#x201c;I, prince Nubadola, assure you that this is my message, and it is legitimate.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can trust this e-mail and any others that come from me.&#x201d;&nbsp; </i>Now you know it is legitimate... because it says so in the e-mail.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp;Some philosophies state that we can never escape circular reasoning because the arguments always come back to axioms or first principles, but in those cases, the circles are very large and do manage to share useful information in determining the truth of the proposition.

    <p class="Body">

    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      In an example used by Sigmund Freud in <i>The Interpretation of Dreams</i>, a man accused by his neighbor of having returned a kettle in a damaged condition offered three arguments:
    </p>
    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      That he had returned the kettle undamaged;<br>That it was already damaged when he borrowed it;<br>That he had never borrowed it in the first place.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;Each statement contradicts the one before. If it was already damaged, how did he return it undamaged? If he never borrowed it, how was it already damaged when he borrowed it?

    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      I don't believe in God. One reason is that I think he is evil. And by the way, there is no such thing as &quot;evil;&quot; it is just our evaluation of what we believe is wrong.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;There are multiple statements here that all contradict, stemmed from the idea that the person does not believe in God. If he or she does not believe in God, how can he or she think God is evil? And if there is no such thing as evil, how can something be evil?
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp;If one acknowledges that their previous argument has been defeated (explicitly or implicitly), and they make a new argument, this would be more like moving the goalposts.

      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;This fallacy creates an endless loop that actually explains nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is fallacious reasoning to accept an explanation that creates this kind of endless loop that lacks any explanatory value.

    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      Dicky: So how do you think life began?

    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation: </strong>This fallacy can be tricky because maybe it is true that aliens are responsible for spreading life, so the answers might be technically right, but the question implied is how life <i>ultimately</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;began, which this form of reasoning will not answer.

    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp;There might be some exceptions that rely on high-level epistemology having to do with a large enough loop and validating feedback.&nbsp;&nbsp;The important question to ask is, does the explanation have any value and is the question being answered or deflected?

    <p>
      (Also known as: Jargon, Catchphrase, Trendy Term)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - **Description**: A buzzword is a word or phrase that is fashionable 
      and widely used within a particular field or context. It often lacks 
      precise meaning but is used to create an impression of sophistication or 
      expertise.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- Term or phrase used to convey a sense of relevance or modernity, 
      often without substantive content.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Term**: &quot;Synergy&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Explanation**: In business contexts, &quot;synergy&quot; is often used to 
      suggest that combining efforts will result in greater effectiveness. 
      However, it can be vague and used more to impress than to convey 
      specific strategies.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Term**: &quot;Disruptive innovation&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Explanation**: This term is used to describe innovations that 
      radically change industries. While it sounds impactful, it can be 
      overused to the point of losing clear meaning and becoming a cliché.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Jargon**: Specialized terms used by a particular profession or 
      group, often becoming buzzwords when they enter wider usage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Catchphrase**: A memorable phrase that becomes popular and is 
      frequently used, sometimes as a buzzword.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip**: Be cautious of buzzwords in communication; they can obscure 
      meaning and reduce clarity. Always consider the specific context and 
      seek precise definitions when encountering buzzwords.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception**: Not all widely used terms are buzzwords. Terms that 
      have clear, substantive meanings and are used accurately do not fall 
      into the category of buzzwords.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact**: The term &quot;buzzword&quot; itself can become a buzzword when 
      overused in discussions about trends or jargon, highlighting its own 
      example of the phenomenon it describes.

  </li><li><span style="color: #606060; font-size: 8pt; ">Dog whistle (politics)</span>
    <p>
      (also known as: Code word (figure of speech))
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - **Description**: In politics, a dog whistle is a subtle or coded 
      message designed to appeal to a specific group of people without 
      attracting the attention of others. It uses language that has a 
      specific, often controversial, meaning to certain audiences while 
      appearing innocuous to the general public.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- A statement or phrase that conveys one meaning to the general public 
      while carrying a different, often politically charged, connotation to a 
      targeted audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Statement**: &quot;We need to restore traditional values.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Explanation**: To some, this may seem like a call to return to 
      conservative principles, but to others, it may be interpreted as a 
      veiled appeal to more controversial social or racial prejudices.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Statement**: &quot;Law and order.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Explanation**: While this might be seen as a straightforward call 
      for increased policing, it can also resonate with voters who have 
      concerns about crime in certain communities, and may subtly signal 
      support for harsher policies.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Coded Language**: Similar to a dog whistle, but can be used in 
      various contexts beyond politics, such as marketing or social commentary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Veiled Speech**: General term for language that subtly implies 
      certain ideas without overtly stating them.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip**: When analyzing political rhetoric, be attentive to language 
      that may carry hidden meanings or appeal to specific demographic groups, 
      particularly when it seems vague or ambiguous.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception**: Not all ambiguous or vague language is a dog whistle; 
      some statements might be unclear due to poor communication rather than 
      intentional manipulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact**: The term &quot;dog whistle&quot; comes from the idea that a dog 
      whistle emits a sound that is inaudible to humans but can be heard by 
      dogs. Similarly, dog whistle politics involves messages that are clear 
      to a targeted group but not to the general populace.

    <p>
      (Also known as: Vague Praise, Euphemism)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - **Description**: A glittering generality is a propaganda technique 
      that uses vague, emotionally appealing phrases that sound good but lack 
      substantive content. These terms are designed to evoke positive feelings 
      without providing specific information or evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P** is presented with positive, emotionally charged terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P** is made to appear virtuous or desirable without clear 
      explanation or details.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Phrase**: &quot;Freedom and democracy for all&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Explanation**: This phrase sounds idealistic and positive but is 
      vague about how freedom and democracy will be achieved or what specific 
      actions will be taken. It aims to elicit support by appealing to broad, 
      desirable values.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Phrase**: &quot;Join the movement for a brighter future&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Explanation**: This phrase is emotionally appealing and suggests a 
      positive outcome (&quot;brighter future&quot;) but does not explain what the 
      movement entails or how it will create this future. It focuses on the 
      attractiveness of the goal rather than the specifics.

    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Euphemism**: A type of glittering generality where a pleasant or 
      neutral term is used to replace a more straightforward or harsh term.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Positive Labeling**: Using attractive labels to make something 
      seem more appealing without detailing its actual attributes.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip**: When evaluating statements or slogans, look beyond the 
      glittering generalities. Seek specific information and evidence to 
      understand the true meaning and implications of the claims being made.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception**: Glittering generalities are not inherently deceptive; 
      they become problematic when used to obscure or avoid substantive 
      discussion. A phrase can be both emotionally appealing and specific if 
      it provides clear and actionable information.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact**: The term &quot;glittering generality&quot; is often used in 
      discussions about advertising and political rhetoric. It highlights how 
      language can be crafted to influence emotions rather than convey factual 
      information.

    <p>
      ### OPROP!
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Name**: OPROP!
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Also known as**: Opraab! (1940-Danish), Opråb! (modern Danish), 
      Proclamation, Exclamation
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Description**: OPROP! refers to a German airborne propaganda leaflet 
      dropped over Danish cities during the German invasion of Denmark on 
      April 9, 1940. Authored by General Leonhard Kaupisch, the leaflet was 
      written in broken Danish mixed with Norwegian. It aimed to justify the 
      German invasion, portray the action as protective of Danish and 
      Norwegian neutrality against British aggression, and persuade the Danish 
      people to accept the German presence without resistance while 
      negotiations were underway.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P** is presented as a protective action against a greater threat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P** is justified as a necessary measure to safeguard neutrality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P** implies that resistance is futile and would lead to greater 
      harm.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Text**: &quot;We are here to protect Danish neutrality from British 
      aggression.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Explanation**: This statement frames the German invasion as a 
      protective measure rather than an aggressive act, aiming to legitimize 
      the invasion and reduce resistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Text**: &quot;Churchill is a warmonger; his actions threaten us all.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Explanation**: By labeling Winston Churchill as a warmonger, the 
      leaflet attempts to redirect blame and justify the German invasion, 
      portraying it as a defensive necessity.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Propaganda Leaflets**: Similar leaflets were used in other 
      contexts to influence public perception and morale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Psychological Warfare**: This technique is part of broader 
      psychological strategies used during conflicts to impact civilian and 
      military morale.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip**: When interpreting historical propaganda, consider the context 
      in which it was produced and the intended impact on its audience. 
      Evaluate the claims made and the language used critically.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception**: While effective in this case, propaganda leaflets like 
      OPROP! can sometimes backfire if the claims are not credible or if the 
      audience is already skeptical of the propagandist's intentions.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact**: The broken Danish used in the OPROP! leaflet was 
      actually due to the hasty translation of a similar leaflet intended for 
      Norway. The quick adaptation underscores the urgency and ad-hoc nature 
      of wartime propaganda efforts.

    <p>
      (Also known as: Weasel term)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - **Description**: Weasel words are vague or ambiguous terms used to 
      create an impression of meaning or certainty without committing to a 
      specific position. They are often used to mislead or evade a clear 
      statement, allowing the speaker or writer to avoid accountability or 
      precise definition. The term &quot;weasel word&quot; comes from the behavior of 
      weasels, which are said to suck the contents out of eggs while leaving 
      the shell intact.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Claim**: The statement is made using vague language.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Weasel Word**: The word or phrase that undermines the clarity or 
      specificity of the claim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Implication**: The statement appears substantive but lacks 
      concrete detail or commitment.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Text**: &quot;Studies suggest that many people find this product 
      effective.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Explanation**: The term &quot;studies suggest&quot; is a weasel phrase that 
      implies evidence without specifying the nature of the studies or the 
      findings, thus avoiding direct validation.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Text**: &quot;Our product may help you achieve your goals.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Explanation**: The word &quot;may&quot; is a weasel term that indicates 
      potential without guaranteeing results, thus shielding the speaker from 
      accountability if the product does not meet expectations.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Vague Terms**: Phrases like &quot;experts agree,&quot; &quot;often,&quot; or &quot;some 
      say&quot; serve similar purposes by implying authority or consensus without 
      providing specifics.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Evasive Language**: Words and phrases used to avoid direct answers 
      or commitments, such as &quot;could,&quot; &quot;might,&quot; or &quot;likely.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip**: When analyzing statements, identify and scrutinize weasel 
      words to assess the clarity and validity of the claim. Ask for specifics 
      and evidence to verify the substance of the statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception**: Weasel words can sometimes be used legitimately to 
      reflect uncertainty or to allow for flexibility in complex or evolving 
      situations. In such cases, context and intent are crucial for evaluation.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact**: The term &quot;weasel word&quot; derives from the idea that a 
      weasel can sneakily remove the contents of an egg without breaking the 
      shell. Similarly, weasel words sneakily avoid making a clear or direct 
      statement.

    <p>
      (Also known as: Suggestive Question)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Description**: A leading question is designed to prompt or guide the 
      respondent towards a specific answer, often reflecting the questioner's 
      bias or desired outcome. It suggests or implies a particular answer 
      within the question itself, which can influence or manipulate the 
      respondent's reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Question**: The question is phrased in a way that guides or 
      suggests a particular response.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Implication**: The structure of the question steers the respondent 
      toward a specific answer, thus revealing the questioner's bias or 
      intention.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Text**: &quot;Don’t you think that the new policy is unfair to 
      employees?&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Explanation**: This question implies that the policy is unfair and 
      seeks to elicit agreement, rather than allowing the respondent to 
      independently evaluate the fairness of the policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Text**: &quot;How did you feel about the movie, considering how many 
      awards it won?&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Explanation**: The question assumes that winning many awards is a 
      positive aspect of the movie, guiding the respondent to evaluate the 
      movie positively.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation**:
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Loaded Question**: A question that contains a presumption or 
      assumption that the respondent may not agree with, but which is 
      difficult to answer without accepting the assumption.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Push Poll**: A type of survey designed to sway respondents towards 
      a particular viewpoint through the phrasing of questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip**: To avoid or counter leading questions, rephrase the question 
      to be neutral and open-ended, allowing the respondent to provide an 
      unbiased answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception**: Leading questions can be used effectively in certain 
      contexts, such as in legal cross-examinations, where the aim is to 
      reveal inconsistencies or specific details through strategic questioning.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact**: The concept of leading questions is well-known in legal 
      contexts, where they are often used deliberately to guide witnesses or 
      to reveal particular aspects of a case.

    <strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;An argument or claim in which two completely opposing arguments appear to be logically equivalent when in fact they are not. The confusion is often due to one shared characteristic between two or more items of comparison in the argument that is way off in the order of magnitude, oversimplified, or just that important additional factors have been ignored.

    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Logical Form:</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="display: block; padding-left: 20px; font-style: italic">
      Thing 1 and thing 2 both share characteristic A.
    </p>
    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="display: block; padding-left: 20px; font-style: italic">
      Therefore, things 1 and 2 are equal.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Example #1:</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="display: block; padding-left: 20px; font-style: italic">
      President Petutti ordered a military strike that killed many civilians. He is no different than any other mass murder and he belongs in prison!
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;Both president Petutti and a mass murder share the characteristic that something they did resulted in the death of civilians. However, the circumstances, the level of responsibility, and the intent are significantly different for the president than the typical mass murder and ignoring these factors is unreasonable, thus makes the argument fallacious.

    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Example #2:</strong>&nbsp;Using the second amendment as justification to allow civilians to own nuclear submarines.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation: </strong>In this case, the first &quot;thing&quot; is the weapon as understood at the time the second amendment was passed. The second &quot;thing&quot; of comparison is the nuclear submarine, also a weapon, but one of significantly different magnitude. This example also introduces the difference between a legal justification and an argumentative one (see <i><a href="https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/logicalfallacies/Appeal-to-the-Law" target="fallacy" data-toggle="tooltip" title="" data-original-title="When following the law is assumed to be the morally correct thing to do, without justification, or when breaking the law is assumed to be the morally wrong thing to do, without justification.">appeal to the law</a></i>).
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp;Like most fallacies, this is one of degree rather than kind. The order of magnitude can be debated. Some may exaggerate this order of magnitude claiming a fallacy where it would be unreasonable to do so.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Tip:</strong>&nbsp;Listen and read carefully. Often, people will make analogies and others will interpret them as claims of equivalence.

    <strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;Appealing to an irrelevant, unqualified, unidentified, biased, or fabricated source in support of an argument (modern usage). Historical use of this fallacy was in the attribution of &quot;religious&quot; or &quot;spiritual&quot; experiences to outside &quot;higher&quot; sources rather than internal, psychological processes (see <i><a href="https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/logicalfallacies/Fantasy-Projection" target="fallacy" data-toggle="tooltip" title="" data-original-title="Confusing subjective experiences, usually very emotionally charged, with objective reality, then suggesting or demanding that others accept the subjective experience as objective reality.">fantasy projection</a></i>).

      <strong>Tip:</strong>&nbsp;A great response for &#x201c;you&#x2019;re taking that out of context&#x201d; is &#x201c;please do explain it to me in context.&#x201d; If they can&#x2019;t or won&#x2019;t, it is likely that context doesn&#x2019;t make the argument any more palatable.

    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;This is a very common form of this fallacy that has many variations.&nbsp;&nbsp;Every time one group member denounces another group member for doing or saying something that they don&#x2019;t approve of, usually by the phrase, &#x201c;he is not really a <i>true</i>&nbsp;[insert membership here]&#x201d;, this fallacy is committed.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      The universal claim here is that no UbaTuba White Men's Club member will ever (universal) go to jail.&nbsp;&nbsp;Marvin points out how clearly this is counterfactual as there are many UbaTuba White Men's Club members in jail.&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead of conceding or meaningfully revising the claim, the implication that no &quot;UbaTuba White Men's Club members&quot; is changed to &#x201c;no true UbaTuba White Men's Club members&#x201d;, which is not meaningful because John&#x2019;s definition of a &#x201c;true UbaTuba White Men's Club member&#x201d; apparently can only be demonstrated in the negative if an UbaTuba White Men's Club member goes to jail.&nbsp;&nbsp;This results in the <i><a href="https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/logicalfallacies/Questionable-Cause" target="fallacy" data-toggle="tooltip" title="" data-original-title="Concluding that one thing caused another, simply because they are regularly associated.">questionable cause</a></i>&nbsp;fallacy as it is also an <i><a href="https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/logicalfallacies/Unfalsifiability" target="fallacy" data-toggle="tooltip" title="" data-original-title="Confidently asserting that a theory or hypothesis is true or false even though the theory or hypothesis cannot possibly be contradicted by an observation or the outcome of any physical experiment, usually without strong evidence or good reasons.">unfalsifiable</a></i>&nbsp;claim, and of course, it commits the <i>no true Scotsman</i>&nbsp;fallacy.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp;A revised claim going from universal to specific that does give an objective standard would not be fallacious.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Variations: </strong>The more generic <i>appeal to purity</i>&nbsp;can be seen when the claim is that someone &quot;does not have enough of&quot; something, which is why they are not meeting the condition. For example, &quot;If you have the desire for success, you will succeed!&quot; Billy has the desire but is not succeeding. Therefore, Billy's desire is not strong (or pure) enough. The difference between the <i>appeal to purity</i>&nbsp;and the <i>no true Scotsman</i>&nbsp;is one of degree versus authenticity.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      Another variation is what I call the <em>no true crossover fallacy</em>. This fallacy is committed when one denies, for the purpose of protecting one of the groups, that an individual can be a part of two or more non-exclusionary groups. During the protests in the spring of 2020, many businesses have been vandalized, looted, and even burned down. When people blamed this on the protesters, the defense was that &#x201c;protesters protest and looters loot.&#x201d; The implication is that the moment a protester loots, they become a &#x201c;looter,&#x201d; and no longer are part of the group &#x201c;protesters.&#x201d; This is a way of absolving every &#x201c;true&#x201d; member of the group &#x201c;protesters&#x201d; from any wrongdoing. It is likely that there are a group of looters who are opportunists and have no ideological position and would not qualify in any reasonable way as &#x201c;protesters.&#x201d; It is clear, however, that there are protesters who believe looting is an effective tool for protesting. Similarly, attempting to absolve police officers from wrongdoing because &#x201c;police officers police and criminals commit crimes&#x201d; is equally as fallacious for all the same reasons.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Tip:</strong>&nbsp;People will sometimes claim outright that if any person who claims to be a member of group X and has Y characteristic, is not a member of group X. Ask them if those who claim to be a member of group X and has Y characteristic would agree.

    <p>
      (Also Known As Motte-and-Bailey Doctrine, Motte-and-Bailey Strategy)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - **Description:** The motte-and-bailey fallacy is an informal logical 
      fallacy in which an arguer conflates two positions: one that is modest 
      and defensible (the &quot;motte&quot;) and another that is more controversial and 
      harder to defend (the &quot;bailey&quot;). When faced with criticism, the arguer 
      retreats to the more defensible position (the motte) and asserts that 
      this is the position they were arguing for all along, while the more 
      contentious position (the bailey) remains unchallenged.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P1:** An argument is advanced for a controversial and 
      difficult-to-defend position (the bailey).
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P2:** When challenged, the arguer retreats to a more modest and 
      easily defensible position (the motte).
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **C:** The original controversial position is left unaddressed, as 
      the critic is misled into focusing on the less contentious position.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1:** Claiming &quot;morality is socially constructed&quot; as a broad 
      argument (the bailey) and when challenged, retreating to the claim that 
      &quot;our beliefs about right and wrong are socially constructed&quot; (the motte).
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** The arguer shifts from the broader, more contentious 
      claim about the non-existence of objective morality to the more 
      defensible position that moral beliefs are shaped by social constructs, 
      thereby avoiding direct criticism of the controversial claim.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2:** Defending a strong sociological perspective that all 
      knowledge is equally valid (the bailey) while retreating to the less 
      contentious claim that knowledge is what people generally accept (the 
      motte) when faced with criticism.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** The arguer deflects attention from the contentious 
      idea that scientific knowledge is no different from other beliefs by 
      focusing on the more defensible claim that knowledge is based on 
      societal acceptance, sidestepping a deeper critique of the original 
      argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation:** The motte-and-bailey fallacy can manifest in various 
      contexts, including political debates, academic arguments, and everyday 
      discussions, where terms and positions are strategically shifted to 
      evade criticism.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip:** To identify and avoid this fallacy, critically examine 
      whether an arguer is shifting between positions and ensure that 
      responses address the original controversial claim directly, rather than 
      being sidetracked by a more defensible but irrelevant position.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception:** The motte-and-bailey fallacy is a specific type of 
      strategic argumentation. Not all shifts in argument are fallacious; 
      sometimes, they reflect genuine adjustments in response to new evidence 
      or perspectives.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact:** The term &quot;motte-and-bailey&quot; comes from medieval castle 
      architecture. The motte is a fortified tower on a mound, while the 
      bailey is a larger, less defensible area surrounding it. The metaphor 
      captures the tactic of retreating to a well-defended position when the 
      more vulnerable one is under attack.

    (also known as: accentus, emphasis fallacy, fallacy of accent, fallacy of prosody, misleading accent)

      <strong>Example #1: </strong>In the movie, <i>My Cousin Vinny</i>, Ralph Maccio's character, Bill, was interrogated for suspected murder. When the police officer asks him, &quot;At what point did you shoot the clerk?&quot; Bill replies in shock, &quot;<em><strong>I</strong></em>&nbsp;shot the clerk? <em><strong>I</strong></em>&nbsp;shot the clerk?&quot; Later in the film, the police officer reads Bill's statement as a confession in court, &quot;...and he said, 'I shot the clerk. I shot the clerk.'&quot;
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation: </strong>In the movie, it appeared that the police officer did understand Bill's question as a confession. So it did not appear to be a fallacious tactic of the police officer, rather a failure of critical thought perhaps due to a strong confirmation bias (the officer was very confident that Bill was guilty, thus failed to detect the nuance in the question).
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Example #2: </strong>In the hilarious Broadway musical, <i>The Book of Mormon</i>, there is a musical number where one character is explaining how to bury &quot;bad thoughts&quot; by just &quot;turning them off&quot; (like a light switch). The character doing the explaining (in glorious song) is specifically explaining to the main character how to suppress gay thoughts when the main character's &quot;bad thoughts&quot; have nothing to do with being gay. After the instructions, the main character tries to make this clear by affirming, &quot;<i><strong>I'm</strong></i>&nbsp;not having gay thoughts,&quot; to which the other characters respond &quot;Hurray! It worked!&quot;
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;The stress on the &quot;I'm&quot; was ignored and confused for &quot;Hey, I'm <i>not</i>&nbsp;having gay thoughts anymore!&quot; Although this was comedy it portrayed an argument.

    <strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;A response to a question that is contingent on the questioner&#x2019;s opinions and makes use of words with strong connotations.&nbsp;&nbsp;This fallacy appears to support both sides of an issue -- a tactic common in politics.

      My friends, I had not intended to discuss this controversial subject at this particular time. However, I want you to know that I do not shun controversy. On the contrary, I will take a stand on any issue at any time, regardless of how fraught with controversy it might be. You have asked me how I feel about whiskey. All right, here is how I feel about whiskey:
    </p>
    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      If when you say whiskey you mean the devil&#x2019;s brew, the poison scourge, the bloody monster, that defiles innocence, dethrones reason, destroys the home, creates misery and poverty, yea, literally takes the bread from the mouths of little children; if you mean the evil drink that topples the Christian man and woman from the pinnacle of righteous, gracious living into the bottomless pit of degradation, and despair, and shame and helplessness, and hopelessness, then certainly I am against it.
    </p>
    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      But, if when you say whiskey you mean the oil of conversation, the philosophic wine, the ale that is consumed when good fellows get together, that puts a song in their hearts and laughter on their lips, and the warm glow of contentment in their eyes; if you mean Christmas cheer; if you mean the stimulating drink that puts the spring in the old gentleman&#x2019;s step on a frosty, crispy morning; if you mean the drink which enables a man to magnify his joy, and his happiness, and to forget, if only for a little while, life&#x2019;s great tragedies, and heartaches, and sorrows; if you mean that drink, the sale of which pours into our treasuries untold millions of dollars, which are used to provide tender care for our little crippled children, our blind, our deaf, our dumb, our pitiful aged and infirm; to build highways and hospitals and schools, then certainly I am for it.

      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;This is an amazing insight into the human mind and the area of rhetoric.&nbsp;&nbsp;We can see how when both sides of the issue are presented through the same use of emotionally charged words and phrases, the argument is really vacuous and presents very little factual information, nor does it even take a stance on the issue.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Example #2: </strong>Having evaluated literally thousands of positions on God by people all over the belief spectrum, I thought I would create my own, &#x201c;If-by-God&#x201d; version of the argument, showing how carefully placed rhetoric can blur the line between the most perfect being imaginable and the most horrible being imaginable.

      The question is, if God does exist, should we love him and worship him?&nbsp;&nbsp;My position is clear, and I am not embarrassed to let the world know exactly how I feel.&nbsp;&nbsp;So here it goes.

      If by God&nbsp;you mean the great dictator in the sky, the almighty smiter, the God who created us with imperfections then holds us responsible for the imperfections, the God who took away paradise and eternal life from us because the first man and woman committed a &#x201c;wrong&#x201d; against God before they were capable of knowing right from wrong, the God who commanded his chosen people to utterly destroy every man, woman, and child in dozens of cities, the God who hardened hearts, killed first-borns, demanded blood sacrifices, commanded man to brutally kill other humans for &#x201c;crimes&#x201d; such as &#x201c;not honoring your parents&#x201d;, the God who destroyed virtually all living creatures on the planet, the God who would demand that his own son be brutally murdered to pay a debt to him, the God who allows children to be born with birth defects, die young, and get cancer, the God who continues to destroy using floods, hurricanes, and other natural disasters, the God who ignores the prayers of billions of his faithful followers, the God who allows a majority of his creation to suffer through unimaginable torture for all eternity in the fiery pits of Hell, then he is certainly not deserving of our love and worship.
    </p>
    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      But, if when you say God you mean the defender, the protector, creator of heaven and earth, the father of us all, the being of pure love, kindness, and everything good in the world, the God who led the Israelites from slavery to freedom, the one who looks after us all, the God who heals the sick in his son&#x2019;s name, the God who gave us his perfect laws for our benefit, the God who loved us so much, that he sacrificed his only son so that we can be saved, the God who allows us to spend a blissful eternity with him and our loved ones, then certainly he is deserving of our love and worship.

    <p>
      (Also Known As: Ambiguity Fallacy, Fallacy of Ambiguity, Amphiboly 
      Fallacy)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - **Description:** The fallacy of amphiboly occurs when an argument is 
      based on a statement that is ambiguous due to its grammatical structure. 
      This type of ambiguity arises from the way words or phrases are arranged 
      in a sentence, leading to multiple possible interpretations. The fallacy 
      exploits this grammatical ambiguity to mislead or confuse the audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P1:** A statement with ambiguous grammatical structure is 
      presented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P2:** The argument relies on one interpretation of the ambiguous 
      statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **C:** The argument is misleading or invalid because the statement 
      could be interpreted in multiple ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1:** &quot;The lawyer said he would help me get out of jail, but 
      he was in fact a con artist.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** This statement could be interpreted in two ways: 
      either the lawyer was genuinely offering legal help or the lawyer was 
      deceitful. The ambiguity in the lawyer's intentions is exploited to 
      mislead about the nature of their actions.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2:** &quot;The sign said 'No parking on the grass.' I parked my 
      car on the gravel, which is next to the grass, so I didn't break any 
      rules.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** The ambiguity here lies in the interpretation of the 
      term &quot;on the grass.&quot; The statement can be read as either strictly 
      prohibiting parking on the grass itself or as implicitly allowing 
      parking on other surfaces close to it. The argument relies on the 
      ambiguous interpretation to avoid breaking the rule.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation:** Amphiboly can involve not only ambiguous grammar but 
      also vague or poorly structured statements that lead to multiple 
      possible meanings.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip:** To avoid falling for the fallacy of amphiboly, ensure that 
      statements are clearly and unambiguously structured. When interpreting 
      ambiguous statements, consider all possible meanings and clarify the 
      intended interpretation.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception:** Not all grammatical ambiguities constitute a fallacy. 
      In some cases, ambiguity is intentional or serves a specific rhetorical 
      purpose without misleading or confusing the audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact:** The term &quot;amphiboly&quot; derives from the Greek word 
      &quot;amphibolos,&quot; meaning &quot;ambiguous&quot; or &quot;having double meaning,&quot; reflecting 
      the fallacy's nature of exploiting linguistic ambiguity.

      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;This is such a common fallacy, yet rarely detected as one.&nbsp;&nbsp;Usually, out of fear of embarrassment, we accept confusing definitions as legitimate elucidations, that is, we pretend the term that was defined is now clear to us. &nbsp;What exactly is the field?&nbsp;&nbsp;How is it detected?

    <p class="Body">
      Assuming we did not really understand what was meant by &#x201c;spirit&#x201d;, the definition, &#x201c;noncorporeal substance&#x201d; might or might not shed any light on what is meant by the term.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, it might be more clear now that Linda is not referring to alcoholic beverages, but conceptually, what is a non-physical substance?&nbsp;&nbsp;If &#x201c;substance&#x201d; is defined as being physical matter or material, does a &#x201c;non-physical&#x201d; substance even make sense?

      <strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp;Some may actually just lack the vocabulary needed -- this is not your fault, but you should do your best to attempt to elucidate using words understandable to your audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Tip:</strong>&nbsp;Failure to elucidate often results in endless and pointless debates. Take, for example, the common position that guns are not a problem in the USA. We often see this position presented as an unhelpful meme, such as &quot;Guns don't kill people, people kill people.&quot; What this needs is a &quot;therefore,&quot; followed by a conclusion. For example, &quot;Guns don't kill people, people kill people. Therefore, we should be focusing more on what makes people use guns violently and less on just banning the use of guns.&quot; This is very different from, &quot;Guns don't kill people, people kill people. Therefore, anyone should be allowed to carry any kind of gun with no restrictions.&quot; Don't waste your time imagining the argument or point the other person is trying to make&#x2014;ask for clarification.

    <p>
      (Also known as: Semantic Pruning, Definitional Retreat)
    </p>
  
    <p http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
      - Description: The fallacy of extensional pruning occurs when a person 
      uses a word or phrase in a way that conforms to its commonly accepted 
      meaning but then retreats to a strictly literal or technical definition 
      when challenged. This allows the user to escape criticism or maintain a 
      position that would otherwise be untenable.

    </p>
    <p http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
      - Logical Form:
    </p>
    <p http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;1. User presents a term or phrase with a broad, commonly understood 
      meaning.
    </p>
    <p http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;2. When challenged, user insists on a strict, literal definition of 
      the term.
    </p>
    <p http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;3. This retreat to a narrow definition avoids addressing the actual 
      implications or expectations associated with the term.

    <p http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
      
    </p>
    <p http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
      - Example #1:
    </p>
    <p http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- Scenario: &quot;While I said I would accept an inquiry, I at no time said 
      that it would be independent, that it would be a public one, or that its 
      findings would be published.&quot;
    </p>
    <p http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- Explanation: The speaker may have agreed to an &quot;inquiry&quot; in a 
      general sense, but by focusing on a strictly literal definition, they 
      evade the broader expectations of what an inquiry typically involves.
    </p>
    <p http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">

    </p>
    <p http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- Explanation: The speaker uses a technical definition of &quot;install&quot; to 
      escape accountability for the switchboard’s functionality. While they 
      may have technically fulfilled the promise, they have avoided the 
      implied responsibility for operational performance.

      whatever you paid for it.&quot;
    </p>
    <p http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- Explanation: The promise appears generous, but by using a technical 
      definition that excludes the tax or additional costs, the offer is less 
      favorable than it seems.
    </p>
    <p http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
      
    </p>
    <p http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
      - Tip: To avoid falling into extensional pruning, ensure that your 
      promises or statements are clear and comprehensive. When evaluating 
      someone else's claims, consider both the commonly understood meaning and 
      any potential technical definitions they might use to narrow their 
      commitment.

    <p http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
      
    </p>
    <p http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
      - Exception: Extensional pruning is not inherently fallacious if it is 
      clear from the context that a literal definition is intended. If the 
      terms are explicitly defined at the outset, then shifting to that 
      definition when challenged is not deceptive.

    </p>
    <p http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">
      - Fun Fact: The fallacy of extensional pruning often appears in 
      advertising and legal contexts, where the fine print or technical 
      details can significantly alter the perceived value or scope of a 
      promise. This technique is particularly prevalent in industries where 
      ambiguity can be strategically used to limit liability.

    <p>
      (Also Known As: Jingle-Jangle Effect, Jingle Fallacy, Jangle Fallacy)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - **Description:** Jingle-jangle fallacies occur when different concepts 
      are mistakenly considered the same due to shared labels (jingle fallacy) 
      or when the same concept is mistakenly treated as different because of 
      varied labels (jangle fallacy). These fallacies lead to confusion and 
      misinterpretation in research and discussions by conflating or 
      differentiating concepts based on superficial naming conventions.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Jingle Fallacy:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- **P1:** Different concepts or phenomena are given the same name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- **P2:** This leads to the assumption that these concepts are 
      identical or closely related.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- **C:** The different concepts are wrongly treated as the same due 
      to their shared label.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **Jangle Fallacy:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- **P1:** The same concept or phenomenon is given different names.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- **P2:** This leads to the assumption that these different names 
      represent different concepts or phenomena.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- **C:** The single concept is wrongly treated as multiple distinct 
      concepts due to its varied labels.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1:** Labeling both &quot;self-esteem&quot; and &quot;self-confidence&quot; as 
      the same construct in psychological research, even though they are 
      distinct constructs.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** The jingle fallacy is at work here, as the shared 
      label causes researchers to overlook the distinct nature of self-esteem 
      and self-confidence, leading to confusion in understanding and measuring 
      these constructs.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2:** Treating &quot;cognitive flexibility&quot; and &quot;adaptive 
      thinking&quot; as different constructs simply because they are referred to by 
      different terms, despite both referring to the same underlying ability 
      to adapt one's thinking to new information.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** The jangle fallacy is evident here, as the different 
      labels cause the mistaken belief that these terms represent different 
      concepts, while they actually refer to the same cognitive ability.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation:** Jingle-jangle fallacies can manifest in various fields, 
      including psychology, education, and social sciences, where terminology 
      and conceptual definitions are crucial for accurate research and theory 
      development.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip:** To avoid jingle-jangle fallacies, carefully define and 
      distinguish concepts at the outset of research and ensure that 
      terminology is consistently applied and understood within the context of 
      the study.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception:** Some level of conceptual overlap is sometimes 
      unavoidable, and minor variations in terminology may be used to capture 
      different facets of a broad concept. However, it is essential to clarify 
      these distinctions to avoid confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact:** The term &quot;jingle-jangle fallacy&quot; was coined by 
      psychologist Campbell in the 1950s to describe how misleading 
      terminology can impact psychological research and theory.

    </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;When an unclear phrase with multiple definitions is used within the argument; therefore, does not support the conclusion.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some will say single words count for the ambiguity fallacy, which is really a specific form of a fallacy known as <i><a href="https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/logicalfallacies/Equivocation" target="fallacy" data-toggle="tooltip" title="" data-original-title="Using an ambiguous term in more than one sense, thus making an argument misleading.">equivocation</a></i>.

    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;The ambiguity here is what exactly &#x201c;good understanding&#x201d; means.&nbsp;&nbsp;The conclusion assumes a much better understanding than is suggested in the premise; therefore, we have the <i>ambiguity fallacy</i>.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Example #2:</strong>
    </p>
    <p style="padding-left: 40px">
      <em><font color="rgb(52, 73, 94)">All living beings come from other living beings.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, the first forms of life must have come from a living being.&nbsp;&nbsp;That living being is God.</font></em>
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;This argument is guilty of two cases of ambiguity.&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the first use of the phrase, &#x201c;come from&#x201d;, refers to <i>reproduction</i>, whereas the second use refers to <i>origin</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that we know quite a bit about reproduction is irrelevant when considering origin.&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, the first use of, &#x201c;living being&#x201d;, refers to an empirically verifiable, biological, living organism.&nbsp;&nbsp;The second use of, &#x201c;living being&#x201d;, refers to a belief in an immaterial god.&nbsp;&nbsp;As you can see, when a term such as, &#x201c;living being&#x201d;, describes a Dodo bird as well as the all-powerful master of the universe, it has very little meaning and certainly is not specific enough to draw logical or reasonable conclusions.

    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;&#x201c;Black Lives Matter&#x201d; is a political ideology that has evolved from a simple declaration. Like all ideologies, it has many branches ranging from moderate to extreme. Bernice clearly has a different concept of Black Lives Matter than Mildred does. An argument can be had over who is perverting the ideology (we have seen this among different Christians for millennia), but the point remains that what is meant by &#x201c;supporting Black Lives Matter&#x201d; has become unclear.

      <strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp;Ambiguous phrases are extremely common in the English language and are a necessary part of informal logic and reasoning.&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as these ambiguous phrases mean the same thing in all uses of phrases in the argument, this fallacy is not committed.

      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;Ken starts with a statement explaining why he thinks there<i>&nbsp;has to be</i>&nbsp;an objective morality -- a statement based on a reasonable argument that can be pursued with reason and logic.&nbsp;&nbsp;Rob adequately answers that objection, as indicated by Ken&#x2019;s move away from that objection to a new objection.&nbsp;&nbsp;This pattern continues until we arrive at an impossible request.&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite all the objections being adequately answered, at no time does Ken concede any points or abandon the argument.

      <strong>Example #2:</strong>&nbsp;Perhaps the most classic example of this fallacy is the argument for the existence of God.&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to the understanding of nature through science, many of the arguments that used to be used for God (or gods) were abandoned, only to be replaced with new ones, usually involving questions to which science has not definitively answered yet.&nbsp;&nbsp;The move from creationism to <i>intelligent design</i>&nbsp;is a prime example.&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently the origin of life is a popular argument for God (although a classic <i><a href="https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/logicalfallacies/Argument-from-Ignorance" target="fallacy" data-toggle="tooltip" title="" data-original-title="The assumption of a conclusion or fact based primarily on lack of evidence to the contrary.

    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp;This fallacy should not be confused with an argument or set of arguments, with multiple propositions inherent in the argument.&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason for the difference between this kind of argument and the <i>moving the goalposts fallacy</i>, is a subtle one, but indicated by a strong initial claim (&#x201c;has to be&#x201d;, &#x201c;must&#x201d;, &#x201c;required for&#x201d;, etc.) that gets answered and/or what appears to be <i><a href="https://www.logicallyfallacious.com/logicalfallacies/Ad-Hoc-Rescue" target="fallacy" data-toggle="tooltip" title="" data-original-title="Very often we desperately want to be right and hold on to certain beliefs, despite any evidence presented to the contrary.

    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Fun Fact:</strong>&nbsp;The name &#x201c;moving the goalposts&#x201d; comes from the analogy of kicking a perfect field goal in American football, only to have the goalposts be moved on you. This would be very unfair.

    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;The salesperson was referring to the different types of cars (models) Toyota makes, not how many instances (or tokens) of each car were manufactured. By not specifically stating &quot;types of cars&quot; or &quot;models,&quot; the statement was ambiguous and unnecessarily confusing.

      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;Greg means that he had the same type of suit as George Clooney. Tim was probably being a smart-ass with his response, but in case he wasn&#x2019;t, he confused the type with the token (that unique suit).

      (also known as: abstraction, concretism, fallacy of misplaced concreteness, hypostatisation, pathetic fallacy [form of], hypostatisation)
    </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;When an abstraction (abstract belief or hypothetical construct) is treated as if it were a concrete, real event or physical entity -- when an idea is treated as if had a real existence.

      <strong>Explanation:&nbsp;</strong>Here, &#x201c;Mother Nature&#x201d; is being portrayed as an autonomous being capable of going to war with humanity.

      <strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp;There may be cases when the number of options really is limited.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, if an ice cream man just has chocolate and vanilla left, it would be a waste of time insisting he has mint chocolate chip.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      It is also not a fallacy if other options exist, but you are not offering other options as a possibility.&nbsp;&nbsp;For example:

    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      Mom: Billy, it&#x2019;s time for bed.

    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      Billy: Can I stay up and watch a movie?
    </p>
    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      Mom: You can either go to bed or stay up for another 30 minutes and read.

    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">

      Billy: This is freaky, our exact conversation is used as an example in this book!
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Tip:</strong>&nbsp;Be conscious of how many times you are presented with false dilemmas, and how many times you present yourself with false dilemmas.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Variation:</strong>&nbsp;Staying true to the definitions, the <i>false dilemma</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;is different from the <i>false dichotomy</i>&nbsp;in that a dilemma implies two equally unattractive options whereas a dichotomy generally comprises two opposites. This is a fine point, however, and is generally ignored in common usage.

  <p>
    <strong>Description:</strong>&#xa0;Comparing a realistic solution with an idealized one, and discounting or even dismissing the realistic solution as a result of comparing to a “perfect world” or impossible standard, ignoring the fact that improvements are often good enough reason.

    <p class="Body">

      What’s the point of making drinking illegal under the age of 21?&#xa0;&#xa0;Kids still manage to get alcohol.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&#xa0;The goal in setting a minimum age for drinking is to deter underage drinking, not abolish it completely.&#xa0;&#xa0;Suggesting the law is fruitless based on its failure to abolish underage drinking completely, is fallacious.

    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&#xa0;There is an implication that the goal of life is not dying.&#xa0;&#xa0;While that is certainly a worthwhile goal, many would argue that it is a bit empty on its own, creating this fallacy where one does not really exist.

    <p>
      (Also known as: Perfect Solution Fallacy, Ideal Solution Fallacy)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      -<span style="font-weight: bold;">&#xa0;Description: </span>This fallacy occurs when an argument is rejected solely because it is not perfect, even though no alternative is perfect either. It involves criticizing an option for its imperfections rather than comparing it to the available alternatives, which may also have flaws.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Logical Form:</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;1. Option A is not perfect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;2. No other available options are perfect either.
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;3. Therefore, Option A should be rejected.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Example #1:</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- Scenario: &quot;We should ban the generation of nuclear power because it can never be made completely safe.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- Explanation: This argument rejects nuclear power due to its imperfections (e.g., safety issues) without considering that other energy sources like coal or oil also have significant risks. The decision should be based on a comparative assessment of all options, not just the flaws of one.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Example #2:</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- Scenario: &quot;I'm against going to the Greek islands because we cannot guarantee we would enjoy ourselves there.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- Explanation: This objection assumes that if perfect enjoyment cannot be guaranteed, the option should be discarded. It fails to acknowledge that no travel destination can guarantee complete enjoyment, and the comparison should be made based on overall potential benefits versus risks.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Variation:</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- Scenario: &quot;We must ban the new heart drug because it has been occasionally associated with neurological disorders.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      &#xa0;&#xa0;- Explanation: The argument highlights the drug's imperfections without considering the potential benefits of saving lives from heart disease. The fallacy lies in focusing on one option's flaws without comparing it to the status quo.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Tip:</span>&#xa0;To avoid the unobtainable perfection fallacy, evaluate options based on their relative merits and practical benefits rather than insisting on an unattainable ideal. Consider how each option compares to the current situation and other available alternatives.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Exception:</span>&#xa0;If a proposed option is flawed to such an extent that it would cause more harm than benefit or is fundamentally unfeasible, then it may justifiably be rejected. However, this should be based on realistic assessments and not an unattainable standard of perfection.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      - <span style="font-weight: bold;">Fun Fact: </span>The unobtainable perfection fallacy is often used in political and public debate to undermine proposed changes by focusing on their imperfections. This technique can be effective in stalling progress and maintaining the status quo, even if the status quo itself is imperfect.

    <strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;When a contributing factor is assumed to be the cause, or when a complex array of causal factors is reduced to a single cause. It is a form of simplistic thinking that implies something is either a cause, or it is not. It overlooks the important fact that, especially when referring to human behavior, causes are very complex and multi-dimensional.

    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;We already established that lead poisoning <i>can contribute</i>&nbsp;to violent behavior (note the probabilistic language).

    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;We made the leap from &quot;contributes&quot; to &quot;can be fixed.&quot; At best, we can conclude that the problem of obesity can be <i>mitigated</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;by people getting more exercise.

      P1. Smoking has been empirically proven to cause lung cancer.<br>C. Therefore, if we eradicate smoking, we will eradicate lung cancer.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;Even though it is reasonable to consider smoking a &quot;cause&quot; of lung cancer versus a &quot;contributing factor&quot; to lung cancer, assuming it is the <strong>only</strong>&nbsp;cause is fallacious.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Tip: </strong>Establishing causality is extremely tricky. Unless you are stating an established fact, start using more probabilistic language such as &quot;contributes to,&quot; &quot;leads to,&quot; &quot;has been known to reduce the effects of,&quot; or similar language.

    (also known as: existential instantiation, the Fallacy of Existential Assumption)
  <p>
    <strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;A formal logical fallacy, which is committed when a categorical syllogism employs two universal premises (&#x201c;all&#x201d;) to arrive at a particular (&#x201c;some&#x201d;) conclusion.

    <p class="Body">
      In a valid categorical syllogism, if the two premises are universal, then the conclusion <i>must</i>&nbsp;be universal, as well.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      The reasoning behind this fallacy becomes clear when you use classes without any members, and the conclusion states that there are members of this class -- which is wrong.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Logical Form:</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      All X are Y.
    </p>
    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      All Z are X.
    </p>
    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      Therefore, some Z are Y.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Example #1: </strong>
    </p>
    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      All babysitters have pimples.
    </p>
    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      All babysitter club members are babysitters.
    </p>
    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      Therefore, some babysitter club members have pimples.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Example #2: </strong>
    </p>
    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      All forest creatures live in the woods.
    </p>
    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      All leprechauns are forest creatures.
    </p>
    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      Therefore, some leprechauns live in the woods.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;In both examples, the fallacy is committed because we have two universal premises and a particular conclusion, but our example #1 conclusion makes sense, no?&nbsp; <strong>Just because the conclusion <i>might</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;be true, does not mean the logic used to produce it, was valid.&nbsp; </strong>This is how tests like SAT&#x2019;s and GRE&#x2019;s screw us over and, technically, in the above example, <i>all</i>&nbsp;babysitter club members have pimples, not just<i>&nbsp;&nbsp;some</i>.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      Now, look at the second example.&nbsp;&nbsp;Same form, but when we use classes that obviously (to most people) have no members (leprechauns), we can see that it results in a conclusion that is false.&nbsp;
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp;There actually <i>is</i>&nbsp;an exception to this formal fallacy -- if we are strictly using Aristotelian logic, then it is permissible because apparently, Aristotle did not see a problem with presupposing that classes have members even when we are not explicitly told that they do.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Tip:</strong>&nbsp;When making a claim, be as precise as possible in the scope of the claim. Don&#x2019;t just say &#x201c;men are bastards,&#x201d; say &#x201c;some men are bastards,&#x201d; or better yet, &#x201c;12.62% of men are bastards.&#x201d;

      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;While it is true that everyone has (or had) a mother, the term &#x201c;mother&#x201d; is not a singular term that is shared -- it is implied that it is a category in which many mothers reside.&nbsp;&nbsp;The conclusion is asserting the opposite of the meaning -- that there is actually just one mother shared by everyone.&nbsp;&nbsp;This form of reasoning is invalid; therefore, fallacious.

    <p>
      (also known as: fallacy of modal logic, misconditionalization, fallacy of neccessity)
    </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;<i>Modal logic</i>&nbsp;studies ways in which propositions can be true or false, the most common being <i>necessity</i>&nbsp;and <i>possibility</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some propositions are necessarily true/false, and others are possibly true/false.&nbsp;&nbsp;In short, a modal fallacy involves making a formal argument invalid by confusing the <i>scope</i>&nbsp;of what is actually necessary or possible.

    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Logical Form:</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="Body" style="padding-left: 40px">
      <font color="rgb(52, 73, 94)"><em>A conditional claim is made using a necessary truth.</em></font><br><font color="rgb(52, 73, 94)"><em>Therefore, conclusion is reached that a possible truth is necessary with no conditional statement.</em></font>
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Example #1:</strong>
    </p>
    <p style="padding-left: 40px">
      <font color="rgb(52, 73, 94)"><em>If Debbie and TJ have two sons and two daughters, then they must have at least one son.</em></font><br><font color="rgb(52, 73, 94)"><em>Debbie and TJ have two sons and two daughters.</em></font><br><font color="rgb(52, 73, 94)"><em>Therefore, Debbie and TJ must have at least one son.</em></font>
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;We are told that Debbie and TJ have two sons and two daughters, so logically, by necessity, they must <i>have at</i>&nbsp;least one son.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, to say that Debbie and TJ <i>must</i>&nbsp;have at least one son, is to <i>confuse the scope of the modal</i>, or in this case, to take the <i>contingent fact</i>&nbsp;that applies to the specific case that is conditional upon Debbie and TJ having the two sons and two daughters, to the general hypothetical case where they don&#x2019;t have to have any children.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, if they don&#x2019;t <i>have to</i>&nbsp;have any children, then they certainly don&#x2019;t <i>have to</i>&nbsp;(<i>necessary fact</i>) have at least one son.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Example #2:</strong>
    </p>
    <p style="padding-left: 40px">
      <font color="rgb(52, 73, 94)"><em>If Barak is President, then he must be 35 years-old or older.</em></font>
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;Technically this is fallacious.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no condition in which someone <i>necessarily</i>&nbsp;is a certain age.&nbsp;&nbsp;More accurately, we would say:
    </p>
    <p style="padding-left: 40px">
      <font color="rgb(52, 73, 94)"><em>It must be the case that if Barak is President, then he is 35 or older.</em></font>
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      The &#x201c;must&#x201d; in this second statement covers the whole condition, not just the age of the president.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Exception: </strong>This is one of those fallacies that would make you look foolish for calling someone out on, unless you are among all academic philosophers. In casual argumentation many people do mean &quot;possibility&quot; and not &quot;necessity.&quot; Remember to offer others a charitable interpretation of their argument.

      Therefore, some non-barking things are non-dogs. (contraposition)
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;We now see the type &#x201c;I&#x201d; form in action, stating, &#x201c;Some&#x201d; dogs bark.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is true, but that really does not matter in determining what form of an argument is valid or not.&nbsp;&nbsp;The conclusion, &#x201c;some non-barking things are non-dogs&#x201d; is also a true statement (my toothbrush, which is a non-dog, does not bark), but this does not matter either.&nbsp;&nbsp;What does matter, is that it does not logically follow.&nbsp;&nbsp;Don&#x2019;t be misled by truth!&nbsp;&nbsp;Focus on the form of the argument.&nbsp;&nbsp;If we substitute other terms we can see the fallacy more clearly:

    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      Some humans are mortal.

      Therefore, some immortals are non-human. (contraposition)
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      By using the word, &#x201c;some&#x201d;, we are not asserting that there are definitely some <i>that are not</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Above, just by saying that some humans are mortal, we automatically are saying that there are others who are not mortal.&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, our conclusion is supposing a group that does not exist, thus fallacious.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp;None, but remember that the following type &#x201c;A&#x201d; and type &#x201c;O&#x201d; forms are valid:

      <strong>Example #2:</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      Science often gets things wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp;It wasn&#x2019;t until the early 20th century when particle physics came along that scientists realized that the atom wasn&#x2019;t the smallest particle in existence.&nbsp;&nbsp;So perhaps science will soon realize that it is wrong about the age of the universe, the non-existence of a global flood, evolution, and every other science fact that contradicts the Bible when read literally.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;To see this fallacy, let&#x2019;s put it in the logical form, using just the evolution claim:
    </p>
    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      P1. Thinking the atom was the smallest particle was a mistake of science.
    </p>
    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      P2. Evolution is also a mistake of science.
    </p>
    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      C. Therefore, science thinking the atom was the smallest particle is like science thinking evolution is true.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      Premise two (P2) should jump out as a bold assumption, although not fallacious.&nbsp;&nbsp;Remember, the premises don&#x2019;t have to be true for the argument to be valid, but if both premises were true, does the conclusion (C) follow?&nbsp;&nbsp;No, because of the <i>extended fallacy</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason is if evolution were false it would not be for the same reason that science thought the atom was the smallest particle.&nbsp;&nbsp;Science &#x201c;was wrong&#x201d; in that case because it did not have access to the whole truth due to discoveries yet to be made at the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;If evolution were wrong, then all the discoveries that have been made, the facts that have been established, the foundation of many sciences that have led to countless advances in medicine, would all be dead wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp;This would be a mistake of unimaginable proportions and consequences that would unravel the very core of scientific understanding and inquiry.

    <p>
      (also known as: dicaeologia)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - **Description:** Anangeon is a fallacious argument based on the 
      concept of inevitability or necessity. It argues that certain outcomes 
      or actions were unavoidable, thus justifying or excusing the failure to 
      meet a standard or obligation. This method often serves to mitigate or 
      shift the blame away from the individual’s responsibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P1:** An action or outcome is presented as necessary or inevitable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P2:** The argument uses this inevitability to justify or excuse a 
      failure or fault.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **C:** The individual’s failure or fault is diminished or negated 
      due to the perceived inevitability.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1:** &quot;Yes, I missed school today, but I was sick and 
      wouldn't have learned anything anyway.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** This argument excuses the absence from school by 
      suggesting that the outcome (not learning) was inevitable due to the 
      illness, thus undermining the importance of attending school despite the 
      illness.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2:** &quot;I didn’t finish the project on time, but it was going 
      to be delayed regardless because of unforeseen circumstances.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** Here, the argument claims that the delay was 
      unavoidable due to circumstances, thereby minimizing the responsibility 
      for not completing the project on time.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation:** The term is sometimes used interchangeably with 
      &quot;dicaeologia,&quot; which specifically refers to a defense plea, although 
      &quot;anangeon&quot; is broader in scope.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip:** Be cautious of arguments that rely on inevitability to excuse 
      failures or responsibilities; assess whether the necessity claimed 
      genuinely absolves the fault or merely distracts from addressing the 
      issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception:** Anangeon may be relevant in contexts where unavoidable 
      circumstances genuinely prevent certain actions or outcomes. In such 
      cases, it is important to distinguish between genuine necessity and an 
      excuse to evade responsibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact:** The concept of anangeon reflects ancient Greek 
      rhetorical techniques, showcasing how historical methods of 
      argumentation still influence contemporary discussions on responsibility 
      and fault.

      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&#xa0;Remember why fallacies are so dangerous: because they appear to be good reasoning.&#xa0;&#xa0;The conclusion in example #1 makes sense, but it does not follow logically -- it is an invalid argument.&#xa0;&#xa0;Based on the first two premises, there is no way logically to deduce that conclusion.&#xa0;&#xa0;Now, look at examples #2 and #3.&#xa0;&#xa0;We use the same logical form of the argument, committing the same fallacy, but by changing the terms it is much more clear that something went wrong somewhere, and it did.&#xa0;&#xa0;This kind of argument, the <i>categorical syllogism</i>, cannot have two negative premises and still be valid.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      Just because the conclusion appears true, it does not mean the argument is valid (or strong, in the case of an informal argument).

      <strong>Exception:</strong>&#xa0;No exceptions.

    <p>
      - **Description:** A vacuous truth is a statement that is considered 
      true because its antecedent (the condition or premise) is false. This 
      makes the entire conditional statement or universal statement true 
      regardless of the truth value of the consequent (the result or 
      conclusion). It often appears as a result of the logical structure of 
      material conditionals or universal quantifications where the antecedent 
      cannot be satisfied.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P1:** A conditional statement is in the form &quot;If P, then Q.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P2:** The antecedent (P) is false.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **C:** The conditional statement is true regardless of the truth 
      value of the consequent (Q).
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1:** &quot;If Tokyo is in Spain, then the Eiffel Tower is in 
      Bolivia.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** The antecedent &quot;Tokyo is in Spain&quot; is false. 
      Therefore, the entire conditional statement is vacuously true regardless 
      of whether &quot;the Eiffel Tower is in Bolivia&quot; is true or false.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2:** &quot;All cell phones in the room are turned off.&quot; (when no 
      cell phones are present in the room)
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** The antecedent &quot;There are cell phones in the room&quot; is 
      false because there are no cell phones. Therefore, the statement is 
      vacuously true because the condition (presence of cell phones) is not 
      met.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation:** The concept also applies to universal statements. For 
      example, &quot;All elements of an empty set satisfy a given property&quot; is 
      vacuously true because there are no elements to contradict the property.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip:** When encountering statements that seem to be true due to the 
      impossibility of the antecedent, check if they are vacuous truths. This 
      can help clarify whether the statement provides meaningful information 
      or is merely a logical artifact.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception:** Vacuous truths are not meaningful in themselves but are 
      valid within the framework of classical logic. They are particularly 
      useful in mathematical proofs, such as base cases in induction, where 
      they help establish the validity of broader statements.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact:** Vacuous truths often arise in everyday language as 
      idiomatic expressions indicating impossibility, such as &quot;when pigs fly,&quot; 
      where the antecedent (&quot;pigs flying&quot;) is understood as impossible, making 
      any consequent true by default.

    <strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;The assertion that a position is different from another position based on the language when, in fact, both positions are the same -- at least in practice or practical terms.

      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;Before you say, &#x201c;Amen!&#x201d;, realize that this is a clear case of <i>distinction without a difference</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is absolutely no difference here because the only possible way to read the Bible is through interpretation, in other words, what we think it says.&nbsp;&nbsp;What is being implied here is that one's own interpretation (what he or she thinks the Bible says) is what it really says, and everyone else who has a different interpretation is not really reading the Bible for what it says.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp;It is possible that some difference can be very minute, exist in principle only, or made for emphasis, in which case the fallacy could be debatable.

    <strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;A formal fallacy due to confusing the knowing of a thing (<i>extension</i>) with the knowing of it under all its various names or descriptions (<i>intension</i>).

    <p class="Body">
      We need to define two terms here to understand this fallacy fully: <i>intensional</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;and <i>extensional</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;In logic and mathematics, an <i>intensional</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;definition gives the meaning of a term by specifying all the properties required to come to that definition, that is, the necessary and sufficient conditions for belonging to the set being defined.&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast, an <i>extensional</i>&nbsp;definition is defined by its listing everything that falls under that definition.&nbsp;&nbsp;Confused?&nbsp;&nbsp;You should be, but relax because I am not done.

      Imagine Superman, who is also Clark Kent, flew to Italy for a slice of pizza.&nbsp;&nbsp;If we said, &#x201c;Clark Kent flew to Italy for pizza&#x201d; we would be right, because of the <i>extensional context</i>&nbsp;of that statement.&nbsp;&nbsp;Conversely, if we said, &#x201c;Lois Lane thinks Superman flew to Italy for pizza&#x201d;, we would still be making a true claim, although the context is now <i>intensional</i>&nbsp;as indicated by the term, &#x201c;thinks&#x201d;.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now if we said, &#x201c;Lois Lane thinks Clark Kent flew to Italy for pizza&#x201d;, we would be wrong and would have committed this fallacy because Lois<i>&nbsp;does not believe that</i>, even though <i>extensionally</i>&nbsp;it is the case (this is after the kiss that wiped her memory of Clark being Superman).

      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;This might be the case, but we cannot logically <i>imply</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;that this is the case because the use of &#x201c;some&#x201d; does not logically imply that it does not mean &#x201c;all&#x201d;.&nbsp;&nbsp;In everyday use, &#x201c;some&#x201d; does <i>implicate</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&#x201c;not all&#x201d;, that is why this is fallacious and could be used to deceive without technically lying.

    <p>
      (also known as: neglecting base rates, base rate neglect, prosecutor's fallacy [form of])
    </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;Ignoring statistical information in favor of using irrelevant information, that one incorrectly believes to be relevant, to make a judgment.&nbsp;&nbsp;This usually stems from the irrational belief that statistics don&#x2019;t apply to a situation, for one reason or another when, in fact, they do.

    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Example #1:</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      Only 6% of applicants make it into this school, but my son is brilliant!&nbsp;&nbsp;They are certainly going to accept him!
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;Statistically speaking, the son may still have a low chance of acceptance. The school is for brilliant kids (and everyone knows this), so the vast majority of kids who apply are brilliant. Of the whole population of brilliant kids who apply, only about 6% get accepted. So even if the son is brilliant, he still has a low chance of being accepted (about 6%).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Example #2:</strong>&nbsp;Faith healing &quot;works,&quot; but not all the time, especially when one&#x2019;s faith is not strong enough (as generally indicated by the size of one&#x2019;s financial offering).&nbsp;&nbsp;Unbiased, empirical tests, demonstrate that a small but noticeable percentage of people are cured of &#x201c;incurable&#x201d; diseases such as cancer.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation:</strong>&nbsp;This is true.&nbsp;&nbsp;However, what is not mentioned in the above is the number of cases of cancer that just go away without any kind of faith healing, in other words, the <i>base rate</i>&nbsp;of cancer remission.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a statistical certainty that among those with cancer, there will be a percentage with spontaneous remission.&nbsp;&nbsp;If that percentage is the same as the faith-healing group, then that is what is to be expected, and no magic or divine healing is taking place.&nbsp;&nbsp;The following is from the American Cancer Society:
    </p>
    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      Available scientific evidence does not support claims that faith healing can cure cancer or any other disease. Some scientists suggest that the number of people who attribute their cure to faith healing is lower than the number predicted by calculations based on the historical percentage of spontaneous remissions seen among people with cancer. However, faith healing may promote peace of mind, reduce stress, relieve pain and anxiety, and strengthen the will to live.<a title="" href="http://www.logicallyfallacious.com/index.php/logical-fallacies/60-base-rate-fallacy#_ftn1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp;If there are factors that increase one&#x2019;s odds and alter the known statistical probabilities, it would be a reasonable assumption, as long as the variations from the statistical norm are in line with the factors that cause the variation.&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, perhaps the mother in our first example knows that her son is gifted musically, that counts for something, then it is not unreasonable to expect a better than 6% probability -- but assuming a 50%, 80%, or 100% probability, is still committing the fallacy.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Variation:</strong>&nbsp;The <em>prosecutor's fallacy</em>&nbsp;is a fallacy of statistical reasoning best demonstrated by a prosecutor when exaggerating the likelihood of a defendant's guilt. In mathematical terms, it is the claim that the probability of A given B is equal to the probability of B given A. For example,
    </p>
    <p class="Body" style="padding-left: 40px">
      <font color="rgb(52, 73, 94)"><em>The probability that you have a cervix given that you are pregnant is the same as the probability that you are pregnant given that you have a cervix.</em></font>
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      Clearly, this is wrong. The probability that you have a cervix if you are pregnant is close to 100% (leaving room for weird science and magic). The probability that you are pregnant if you have a cervix is dependent on many other factors, but let&#x2019;s just say it is a lot less than 100%. In legal cases, a prosecutor may abuse this fallacy to convince the jury that the chance of the defendant being innocent is very small, when it fact, if the whole population were considered (as it should be), the chance of the defendant being guilty (based on that statistic alone) is very small.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Tip:</strong>&nbsp;Take some time in your life to read a book or take a course on probability.&nbsp;&nbsp;Probability affects our lives in so many ways that having a good understanding of it will continually pay off.

<li><span style="color: #606060; font-size: 8pt; ">Defense attorney's Fallacy</span>
    <p>
      - **Description:** The Defense Attorney's Fallacy is a logical fallacy 
      that occurs when a defense attorney argues that evidence implicating 
      their client is not sufficient because it could apply to a large segment 
      of the population. Essentially, it denies the significance of the 
      evidence by arguing that since many others could fit the description or 
      exhibit the characteristic, it cannot be used to single out the 
      defendant.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P1:** A piece of evidence is presented that links a characteristic 
      (e.g., blood type) to a crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P2:** A significant portion of the population has this 
      characteristic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **C:** Therefore, the evidence cannot implicate the defendant, as it 
      could apply to anyone with that characteristic.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1:** &quot;The defendant has B positive blood, but 10 percent of 
      the population has B positive blood. Therefore, this blood type does not 
      implicate the defendant because many others could also be the 
      perpetrator.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** This argument is fallacious because it overlooks the 
      fact that the evidence (B positive blood) is relevant in combination 
      with other evidence or circumstances. The presence of a characteristic 
      in many people does not negate its significance in the context of the 
      case.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2:** &quot;The witness identified someone with a red hat at the 
      crime scene, but many people own red hats. The fact that the defendant 
      owns a red hat does not prove they are the perpetrator because anyone 
      with a red hat could have been at the scene.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** This argument fails to consider that while many 
      people may own red hats, the combination of other evidence (such as the 
      defendant's presence or behavior) is necessary to determine guilt. The 
      sheer number of people with similar characteristics does not invalidate 
      the evidence against the defendant.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation:** Sometimes known as the &quot;Many People Fallacy,&quot; it 
      focuses on the statistical probability of characteristics or behaviors 
      being common among a large number of individuals.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip:** To counter this fallacy, emphasize the cumulative weight of 
      evidence and its relevance to the specific case, rather than focusing on 
      how common a characteristic is in the general population.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception:** The fallacy does not apply if the evidence is indeed 
      irrelevant or insufficient when considering the full context of the 
      case. However, it’s important to demonstrate how the evidence fits into 
      the broader narrative and investigation.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact:** This fallacy can sometimes be seen in both criminal 
      defense and other contexts where individuals or groups attempt to 
      discredit evidence by pointing out its general applicability, rather 
      than addressing its relevance to the specific situation at hand.

    <strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;It is a fallacy in formal logic where in a standard if/then premise, the antecedent (what comes after the &#x201c;if&#x201d;) is made not true, then it is concluded that the consequent (what comes after the &#x201c;then&#x201d;) is not true.

    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation: </strong>It is not that clear that a fallacy is being committed, but because this is a formal argument following a strict form, even if the conclusion seems to be true, the argument is still invalid.&nbsp;&nbsp;This is why fallacies can be very tricky and deceptive.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since it doesn&#x2019;t bark, we cannot conclude with certainty that it isn&#x2019;t a dog -- it could be a dog who just can&#x2019;t bark.

    <p class="Body">
      The arguer has committed a formal fallacy, and the argument is invalid because the truth of the premises does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion.

      Therefore, I have never seen a naked lady.
    </p>
    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Explanation: </strong>The fallacy is more obvious here than in the first example. Denying the antecedent (saying that I don&#x2019;t have cable) does not mean we must deny the consequent (that I have seen a naked lady...I have, by the way, in case you were wondering).

    <p>
      (also known as: making stuff up, MSU fallacy)
    </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Description:</strong>&nbsp;Very often we desperately want to be right and hold on to certain beliefs, despite any evidence presented to the contrary.&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result, we begin to make up excuses as to why our belief could still be true, and is still true, despite the fact that we have no real evidence for what we are making up.

    <p class="Body">
      <strong>Logical Form:</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      Claim X is true because of evidence Y.

      <strong>Exception:</strong>&nbsp;Proposing possible solutions is perfectly acceptable when an argument is suggesting only a possible solution -- especially in a hypothetical situation.

<li><span style="color: #18898b; font-family: &quot;Liberation Sans&quot;, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; ">Escape hatch</span>
    <p>
      - **Description:** An &quot;escape hatch&quot; is a rhetorical device used to 
      evade the burden of proof or sidestep criticism in an argument. It 
      typically involves making unfalsifiable, circular, or absurd claims that 
      are designed to be unanswerable. The intention is to declare victory in 
      the argument by presenting a point that is immune to counter-argument or 
      scrutiny, often leaving the debater with a sense of smugness or relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P1:** A claim is made that is unfalsifiable, circular, or 
      otherwise unanswerable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P2:** The claim is presented as a decisive argument or rebuttal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **C:** The argument is declared won, and the discussion is 
      terminated.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1:** &quot;Science doesn’t know everything, so my belief in 
      astrology must be correct.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** The argument uses the unknowns in science to assert 
      the validity of astrology, avoiding the need to provide concrete 
      evidence for astrology itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2:** &quot;If you don’t succeed in moving mountains through 
      faith, it’s because you didn’t have enough faith.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** The failure to achieve a desired outcome is 
      attributed to the individual's lack of faith rather than a flaw in the 
      belief system, making the argument unchallengeable.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation:** The escape hatch can appear in various forms, such as 
      &quot;science isn’t complete,&quot; &quot;you can’t prove anything,&quot; or claiming that 
      certain practices or beliefs are &quot;beyond the scope of understanding.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip:** To avoid falling into an escape hatch argument, focus on 
      asking for concrete evidence and clarification rather than accepting 
      vague or untestable claims.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception:** Escape hatch arguments can sometimes serve as a signal 
      that the discussion may need to shift from debating specifics to 
      addressing underlying assumptions or methodologies.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact:** The concept of the escape hatch is frequently employed 
      in debates involving pseudosciences and fringe theories, where 
      proponents often resort to unfalsifiable claims to protect their beliefs 
      from scrutiny.

  </li><li><span style="color: #18898b; font-family: &quot;Liberation Sans&quot;, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; ">God of the gaps</span>
    <p>
      - **Description:** &quot;God of the gaps&quot; is a theological concept where gaps 
      in scientific knowledge are attributed to divine intervention or action. 
      Essentially, it is the idea that if something is not yet understood by 
      science, it must be the work of God. This argument is often used to 
      assert the existence of a deity based on the limitations of current 
      scientific explanations.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P1:** There is a gap in scientific knowledge or explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P2:** The gap cannot be currently explained by scientific means.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **C:** The gap must be filled by divine action or intervention.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1:** &quot;Science cannot explain how life began, therefore God 
      must have created life.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** The lack of a scientific explanation for the origin 
      of life is used to argue that God must be the cause. This is an instance 
      of attributing the unknown to divine action rather than waiting for 
      scientific advancement.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2:** &quot;We don’t yet understand how consciousness arises from 
      brain activity, so it must be a result of a divine soul.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** The current inability to fully explain consciousness 
      through neuroscience is used to argue for the existence of a divine 
      element. The gap in understanding is filled with a theological 
      explanation rather than a scientific one.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation:** The concept can also be applied to other areas where 
      science is lacking, such as explanations of natural disasters or 
      specific phenomena, where divine action is posited as the cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip:** Be cautious of relying on &quot;God of the gaps&quot; arguments as they 
      often depend on the current limitations of science rather than a robust 
      argument for the existence of a deity. As scientific knowledge 
      progresses, these gaps may be filled, making the argument less 
      compelling.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception:** The &quot;God of the gaps&quot; argument is often critiqued for 
      shifting as scientific knowledge advances. What was once considered a 
      gap may become understood through future discoveries, potentially 
      rendering the argument obsolete.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact:** The term &quot;God of the gaps&quot; was popularized by theologian 
      and philosopher Karl Barth, who critiqued the use of divine intervention 
      to fill gaps in human understanding.
    </p>
  </li><li><span style="color: #18898b; font-family: &quot;Liberation Sans&quot;, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; ">Handwave</span>
    <p>
      - **Description:** Hand-waving is a term used pejoratively to describe 
      arguments or actions that seem effective or impressive but lack 
      substantive evidence or detail. It often involves glossing over 
      important aspects, using fallacies, or employing misdirection to avoid 
      rigorous scrutiny. In various contexts, it can indicate an attempt to 
      appear productive or convincing without actually providing meaningful 
      contributions.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P1:** A claim or argument is presented that is vague, incomplete, 
      or unsupported.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P2:** The proponent tries to divert attention away from the lack 
      of substance or detail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **C:** The argument or action is perceived as valid or effective, 
      despite its lack of rigor.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1:** &quot;Clearly, the new policy will improve efficiency, but 
      we don’t need to discuss the specifics right now.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** The speaker uses the term &quot;clearly&quot; to assert that 
      the policy will improve efficiency, while avoiding any detailed 
      discussion or evidence that might support or refute the claim.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2:** &quot;The product will revolutionize the industry—just 
      trust us on this; the technical details are too complex to explain here.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** The claim is made without providing concrete details 
      or evidence, with the expectation that the audience will accept the 
      assertion at face value.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation:** Hand-waving can vary in context, such as in debates 
      where it involves logical fallacies and misdirection, in business where 
      it may involve vague claims of productivity, or in academia where it 
      might involve unproven assertions or skipped steps in proofs.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip:** To counter hand-waving, ask for specific evidence and 
      detailed explanations. Challenge any claims that are made with 
      insufficient support or that rely on vague assertions.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception:** In some contexts, such as initial presentations or 
      high-level overviews, a degree of hand-waving might be acceptable if 
      detailed information is provided later. However, persistent or 
      deliberate hand-waving without follow-up can be problematic.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact:** The term &quot;hand-waving&quot; metaphorically relates to the 
      gesture of waving one’s hands to distract or divert attention, much like 
      how stage magicians use hand movements to misdirect their audience from 
      the real tricks being performed. The concept has also been popularized 
      by its use in the Star Wars franchise, where Jedi use hand-waving as a 
      form of mind control.

  </li><li><span style="color: #18898b; font-family: &quot;Liberation Sans&quot;, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; ">PIDOOMA</span>
    <p>
      (also known as:&nbsp;&nbsp;Pulled It Directly Out Of My Ass, argumentum ex culo, 
      Colonic autoextraction methodology, Toilet fishing, 
      Proctolojustification)
    </p>
  
    <p>
      - **Description:** PIDOOMA is a derogatory term for arguments or claims 
      made with little to no evidence, often involving blatant and intentional 
      lies. It represents the act of making up arguments on the spot in a 
      desperate attempt to support a failing position, often characterized by 
      ad hoc reasoning and dubious statistics.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Logical Form:**
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P1:** A claim or argument is made with minimal or no evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **P2:** The claim often involves blatant, fabricated information or 
      lies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- **C:** The argument is presented as valid despite its lack of 
      evidence and reliance on falsehoods.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #1:** A proponent of a conspiracy theory claims, “Statistics 
      show that 90% of all historical events are manipulated by shadowy 
      elites,” without providing any reliable data or sources.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** The statistic is fabricated to support the conspiracy 
      theory, relying on spurious and unverifiable information to lend 
      credibility to the unfounded claim.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Example #2:** Andrew Schlafly’s claim that &quot;Wikipedia is 6 times 
      more liberal than the American public&quot; is an example of PIDOOMA, as the 
      statistic was made up to discredit Wikipedia.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Explanation:** The statistic is created without basis to serve a 
      specific agenda, showing how PIDOOMA involves generating false claims to 
      support a particular argument or viewpoint.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Variation:** PIDOOMA can manifest in various forms, including bogus 
      statistics, exaggerated claims, or ad hoc justifications that lack 
      substantiation.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Tip:** To identify PIDOOMA, look for claims that lack credible 
      evidence, rely on dubious statistics, or seem designed to evade 
      scrutiny. Cross-check information with reliable sources and be cautious 
      of arguments that seem to have been pulled out of nowhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Exception:** In some cases, a claim that initially seems like 
      PIDOOMA might be corrected or substantiated with further evidence. It's 
      important to differentiate between initial fabrications and evolving 
      arguments with emerging evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      - **Fun Fact:** The term &quot;PIDOOMA&quot; humorously references the idea of 
      arguments being &quot;pulled directly out of one's ass,&quot; emphasizing the 
      absurdity and lack of credibility of such claims.
