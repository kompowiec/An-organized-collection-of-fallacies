**bold** - best IMO (if does exists more techniques)
# Argumentum ad ignorantiam
* Explain this fallacy: I should prove THINE claims?
# Strawman
* accuse of them a lie and quote if insists on.
# Ad personam
* Implying that idiot called you are a idiot: thank you for the compliment.
# Tone policing
* It's called diatribe, idiot
# cherry picking
* Anecdotal evidence
# whataboutism
* Use the golden rule: if you claim that X is ok, it means that I can do the same as they do, i.e. X because you thinks X is okay, right?
	* Or more directly: Thanks for your confirmation, that you agree that this is also wrong.
# Argumentum ad populum
* make irrelevant: you don't have to call your buddies, just prove it.
# psychological projection
* You have diagnosed yourself well. I'm impressed. The most important thing is to be honest with yourself.
* How do you know?
* But we are talking about you.
* **because you wanted it**
