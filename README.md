# How to edit
I use [Freeplane](https://www.freeplane.org/wiki/index.php/Home) application.
* .mm - Own XML format freeplane
* .xml - because Freeplane uses own XML format which is not interoperable, here you have, i hope, more useful, raw XML format.
* .svg - XML render for vector graphic format
* .png - Binary raster graphic format
* .txt - human-readable tracking changes to a file.
