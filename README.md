This list is inspired by an organized collection of irrational nonsense, but this list is specialized to fallacies, that is, it concerns the errors of reasoning themselves.

Statistics:

Total number of nodes: 263

Total number of leaf nodes: 203

Number of main branches: 12


# How to edit
I use Freeplane application, because it uses its own XML format which is not interoperable, I also provide SVG and PNG rendered works for easier display.
