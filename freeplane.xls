                                     Overwhelming an interlocutor with as many arguments as possible, without regard for accuracy or strength of the arguments. This is especially disingenuous when the interlocutor is not allowed to interrupt and address the arguments, as in formal debate or in writing. To the spectator unfamiliar with this strategy, the interlocutor’s inability to accurately respond to all the claims in the given time is fallaciously seen as a “win” for the Gish Galloper or appears to lend credibility to the arguments made when in fact it does not.

                                    <strong>Example #1: </strong>
                                    The term was coined by Eugenie Scott of the National Center for Science Education in the 1990s. Dr. Scott coined the term based on the behavior of creationist Duane Gish in formal debates. Dr. Scott states:
      
                                </p>

                                    <em>“On the radio, I have been able to stop Gish, et al, and say, ‘Wait a minute, if X is so, then wouldn't you expect Y?’ or something similar, and show that their ‘model’ is faulty. But in a debate, the evolutionist has to shut up while the creationist Gallops along, spewing out nonsense with every paragraph.”</em>
                                          
                                </p>

                                    <strong>Example #2:</strong>
                                     In a 2012 debate between Mitt Romney and President Obama, Romney overwhelmed Obama with many arguments of questionable strength, resulting in many referring to Romney’s strategy as an example of the Gish Gallop. 
      
                                </p>
                                      
                                <p class="Body">
                                            
                                    <strong>Exception:</strong>
                                     The two key characteristics of the Gish Gallop are 1) the number of arguments in uninterrupted succession and 2) the lack of strength of the arguments presented. The number of arguments presented is problematic when the interlocutor doesn’t have a reasonable amount of time (or space if in writing and limited by characters) to respond. The strength of the arguments is debatable, so in the case of Romney and Obama, it can be argued that Romney was making strong arguments, in which case Romney’s crime was simply presenting too many of these arguments at once.

                                    <strong>Fun Fact:</strong>
                                     A thousand bad arguments don’t add up to a single good argument, although many people interpret numerous bad arguments as “strong evidence” (e.g., “they can’t all be wrong” - Yes, they can all be wrong.)

                                        <strong>Explanation:</strong>
                                         This time, as the one evaluating the argument, if you allow the rapid pace of the delivery of the argument to serve as evidence for the claim, you are committing the fallacy.  Perhaps the arguer does sound confident, and perhaps you are embarrassed to ask him to repeat the argument or slow down; therefore, you just accept it.  Either way, that is fallacious reasoning.
        
                                    </p>

                                        <strong>Exception:</strong>
                                         Naturally fast talkers most likely have no intent to deceive, and if you consciously give no undue weight to the claims of a natural fast talker, then no fallacy has been committed.
        
                                    </p>

                                         Work on your pace as a part of your speaking.  It should be just slow enough where you do not lose your audience, and no slower, unless going for a dramatic effect.

      The cum hoc fallacy assumes that events which occur together are causally connected, and leaves no room either for coincidence, or for the operation of an outside factor which separately influences those events.

      Like the post hoc fallacy which links events because they occur consecutively, the cum hoc fallacy links them because they occur simultaneously. It is a fallacy because of its unwarranted assumption that either of the events would not occur without the other one.
    </p>
                            <p>
      Things are happening all the time. Scarcely a day goes by without rain, electricity bills, televised show-jumping, or the Guardian newspaper. It is inviting to link these endemic discomforts with simultaneous events, and conclude that they are all somehow connected. In primitive societies such assumptions are made routinely, and one of the jobs of the witchdoctor is to sort out which actions are linked with various consequences. In our society, alas, life is more complicated.
    </p>
                            <p>
      The field of statistics provides a natural habitat for the cum hoc fallacy to lurk undetected. Indeed, a whole branch of statistics called regression analysis is devoted to measuring the frequency and extent of simultaneous events, and to calculating the probability of their being linked. Correlation coefficients are produced, with percentages attached showing the likelihood that mere chance was involved. Statisticians routinely offer us relationships with a 95 per cent or a 99 per cent probability that ‘more than chance is involved’.

      Most disciplines which involve human measurement, including economics and sociology, find cum hoes scattered liberally on their domain. The reason for this is that we do not really know what makes human beings act, so we look at their actions after the fact and try to relate them to other events. The cum hoc tares grow up with the wheat of genuine insights.

      Deliberate use of the cum hoc ergo propter hoc is best made with the support of reams of statistical information. Your audience, bemused by the figures, rarely have any of their own to set against you. They can be made even more disposed to accept the link which you are proposing if you cite the authority of leading figures in the social sciences. This is easy. There is nothing so absurd that it has not been attested to by such people. It helps to be selective in your use of information.

                                    Doug is convinced he has lucky underwear. One time when he forgot to put on his lucky underwear, he got a parking ticket. Doug concludes that because he forgot to wear his lucky underwear, he got the ticket. Doug doesn't wash his lucky underwear often. This part isn't relevant to the example, but it is disturbing nonetheless.

                                    , he is making a claim of causality based on the order of events (first he forgot his lucky underwear, then he got the ticket.)

The fact is, there is no evidence that his desire had any effect on the win whatsoever. To suggest this is the case, in addition to 
                                    <em>ad hoc reasoning</em>
                                    , would be 
                                    <em>magical thinking</em>
                                      since there is no naturalistic mechanism that could account for his desire resulting in his win.

                                    <strong>Exception:</strong>
                                     If one claims that Y caused X by adding additional details that properly establish causality, this fallacy would not apply.

                                     There is some non-mystical truth to the law of attraction. That which you obsess over you are more likely to adjust your behaviors in a way that will help make your obsession a reality. For example, if you want to graduate college more than anything, you will most likely study harder, ask for extra help, and blow off fewer classes. No magic required.

                                 “Common sense” is contrary to logic and probability, when people think that any possible lottery number is more probable than any other.  This is because we see meaning in patterns -- but probability doesn’t.  Because of what is called the 
                                <i>clustering illusion</i>
                                , we give the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 special meaning when arranged in that order, random chance is just as likely to produce a 1 as the first number as it is a 6.  Now the second number produced is only affected by the first selection in that the first number is no longer a possible choice, but still, the number 2 has the same odds of being selected as 14, and so on.

                                 The dealer (or whatever you call the person spinning the roulette wheel) really should know better -- the fact that red 21 just came up is completely irrelevant to the chances that it will come up again for the next spin.  If it did, to us, that would seem “weird,” but it is simply the inevitable result of probability.

                                 The hot hand fallacy is the irrational belief that if you win or lose several chance games in a row, you are either “hot” or “cold,” respectively, meaning that the streak is likely to continue and has to do with something other than pure probability.  Because we are generally stupid when it comes to realizing this, and pigheaded when it comes to accepting this fact, casinos around the world make a lot of money. This is similar to the

                                <strong>Explanation:</strong>
                                 Statistically, Carlos and Marta are more likely to lose the next game since a) their "streak" is probability-based, not talent-based and b) the odds are against them in the game of craps. Carlos is incorrectly viewing the string of wins as a streak that is more likely to continue than not.

      There are examples based on events that are not purely probabilistic, such as shooting baskets in the game of basketball. These examples are controversial because although some of the success, some of the time can be attributed to probability alone, there is no question that talent and belief can affect the outcome.

      I had a real bad headache, then saw my doctor.  Just by talking with him, my headache started to subside, and I was all better the next day.  It was well worth the $200 visit fee.

                                 Headaches are a part of life, and naturally come and go on their own with varying degrees of pain. They regress to the mean on their own, the “mean” being a normal state of no pain, with or without medical or chemical intervention. Had the person seen a gynecologist instead, the headache would have still subsided, and it would have been a much more interesting visit—especially if he were a man.

      After surgery, my wife was not doing too well -- she was in a lot of pain.  I bought these magnetic wristbands that align with the body's natural vibrations to reduce the pain, and sure enough, a few days later the pain subsided!  Thank you magic wristbands!

                                 It is normal to be in pain after any significant surgery.  It is also normal for the pain to subside as the body heals -- this is the body

                                .  Assuming the magic wristbands caused the pain relief and ignoring the regression back to the mean, is fallacious.

                                 Of course, if the “cause” is explained as the natural regression to the mean, then in a way it is not fallacious.

      We cannot unlock our child from the closet because if we do, she will want to roam the house.  If we let her roam the house, she will want to roam the neighborhood.  If she roams the neighborhood, she will get picked up by a stranger in a van, who will sell her in a sex slavery ring in some other country.  Therefore, we should keep her locked up in the closet.

                                 In this example, it starts out with reasonable effects to the causes.  For example, yes, if the child is allowed to go free in her room, she would most likely want to roam the house -- 95% probability estimate
                                <a title="" href="http://www.logicallyfallacious.com/index.php/logical-fallacies/163-slippery-slope#_ftn1">

                                .  Sure, if she roams the house, she will probably want the freedom of going outside, but not necessarily “roaming the neighborhood”, but let’s give that a probability of say 10%.  Now we start to get very improbable.  The chances of her getting picked up by a stranger (.05%) in a van (35%) to sell her into sex slavery (.07%) in another country (40%) is next to nothing when you do all the math:

      If you accept that the story of Adam and Eve was figurative, then you will do the same for most of the Old Testament stories of similar literary styles.  Once you are there, the New Testament and the story of Jesus does not make sense, which will lead you to believe that the resurrection of Jesus was a “spiritual” one.  Once you accept that, you won’t be a Christian anymore; you will be a dirty atheist, then you will have no morals and start having sex with animals of a barnyard nature.  So you better take the story of Adam and Eve literally, before the phrase, “that chicken looks delicious”, takes on a whole new meaning.

                                 The concept of a “bad day” is part of this fallacy.  You wake up in the morning, and you discover that you are out of coffee.  From there, you fallaciously reason that this means you will be grumpy, late for work, then behind all day in work, then have to stay late, then miss dinner with the family, then cause more friction at home, etc.  This is only true if you act it out as if it is true.  Of course, with an already bad attitude, you look back on the day, block out the good and wallow in the bad, just so you can tell yourself, that you were right all along about having a “bad day”.

                                 When you focus on just that prediction, then it might seem that way, but realize that Nostradamus made over 1000 “predictions”, most (all?) of which are vague nonsense.  Given that many predictions, it is statistically impossible NOT to match at least one with an actual event.  Again, if you ignore the noise (the predictions that do not make any sense), it looks amazing.  By the way, “Hister” is the Latin name for the Danube River.

      Why does the law state that you have to be 21 years old to drink?  Does it really make any difference if you are 20 years and 364 days old?  That is absurd.  Therefore, if a single day makes no difference, then a collection of 1095 single days won’t make any difference. Therefore, changing the drinking age to 18 will not make any difference.

                                 What Willard did not take into consideration is “baldness” is a term used to define a state along a continuum, and although there is no clear point between bald and not bald, the extremes are both clearly recognizable and achievable.

                                 Right out of college, with a degree in marketing, I worked at the Olive Garden (an Italian-like semi-fast food chain here in the States). Perhaps I should have opted for the CD repair right out of high school and saved $120,000. I am pretty sure the Olive Garden would have still hired me.

      There are several specifically emotional fallacies that I list separately in this book, because of their widespread use.  However, keep in mind that you can take any emotion, precede it with, “appeal to”, and you have created a new fallacy, but by definition, the emotion must be used in place of a valid reason for supporting the conclusion.

      Power lines cause cancer.  I met a little boy with cancer who lived just 20 miles from a power line who looked into my eyes and said, in his weak voice, “Please do whatever you can so that other kids won’t have to go through what I am going through.”  I urge you to vote for this bill to tear down all power lines and replace them with monkeys on treadmills.

                                 Notice the form of the example: assertion, emotional appeal, request for action (conclusion) -- nowhere is there any evidence presented.  We can all tear up over the image of a little boy with cancer who is expressing concern for others rather than taking pity on himself, but that has nothing to do with the assertion or the conclusion.

                                 The thought of people torturing babies for fun immediately brings up unpleasant images (in sane people).  The actual argument (implied) is that there are objective (universal) rights and wrongs (morality).  The argument is worded in such a way to connect the argument's conclusions (that there is objective morality) with the idea that torturing babies for fun is wrong (this is also a

                                 Appealing to emotions is a very powerful and necessary technique in persuasion.  We are emotional creatures; therefore, we often make decisions and form beliefs erroneously based on emotions, when reason and logic tell us otherwise.  However, using appeals to emotion as a backup to rational and logical arguments is not only valid, but a skill possessed by virtually every great communicator.

                                 Think in terms of probabilities, not possibilities.  Many things are possible, including a lion busting into your home at night and mauling you to death -- but it is very, very improbable.  People who use fear to manipulate you, count on you to be irrational and emotional rather than reasonable and calculating.  Prove them wrong.

                                 Those who lived through the Coca-Cola identity crises of the mid-eighties know what a mess it was for the company.  In fact, the “New Coke Disaster”, as it is commonly referred to, is literally a textbook example of attempting to fix what isn’t broken.  Coke’s main marketing ploy was appealing to the novelty, and it failed miserably -- even though more people (55%) actually preferred the taste of New Coke, the old was “better”.

                                     It is ridiculous to think that we come from pond scum, and it is not true.  It is more accurate to say that we come from exploding stars as every atom in our bodies was once in a star.  By creating a ridiculous and misleading image, the truth claim of the argument is overlooked.

                                     It is legitimate to use ridicule when a position is worthy of ridicule.  This is a risky proposition, however, because of the subjectiveness of what kind of argument is actually ridicule worthy.  As we have seen, misplaced ridicule can appear as a sign of desperation, but carefully placed ridicule can be a witty move that can work logically and win over an audience emotionally, as well.

                                    <strong>Explanation:</strong>
                                     We first assume the premise is true: if “enough” people prayed to God for the patient's successful surgery and speedy recovery, then God would make it so.  From this, we can deduce that God responds to popular opinion.  However, if God simply granted prayers based on popularity contests, that would be both unjust and absurd.  Since God cannot be unjust, then he cannot both respond to popularity and not respond to popularity, the claim is absurd, and thus false.

                                     like Jesus lived his, the world would be a beautiful place.  If this were true, we would have 7 billion people on this earth roaming from town to town, living off the charity of others, preaching about God (with nobody listening). Without anyone creating wealth, there would be nobody to get charity from -- there would just be 7 billion people all trying to tell each other about God.  After a few weeks, everyone would eventually starve and die.  This world might be a beautiful place for the vultures and maggots feeding on all the Jesus wannabes, but far from a beautiful world from a human perspective.  Since the world cannot be both a beautiful place and a horrible place, the proposition is false.

                                    Cult leaders appear to have a magical level of influence over their followers. They can do no wrong, and anything they say must be true. This mindset is enforced by rewards and punishments related to loyalty. When Jim Jones claimed that hostile forces would convert captured children of the cult to fascism, no fact-checking was involved. Out of loyalty to the leader, Jones’ followers reasoned that suicide was a better alternative and “drank the Kool-Aid” (Flavor Aid). Nine hundred and nine inhabitants of Jonestown died of apparent cyanide poisoning. Three hundred and four of them were children.

                                    <strong>Explanation:</strong>
                                     While my liberal friend did not insist the quote was true, he did refuse to investigate it further out of loyalty to his ideological position. In both politics and religion, people on social media uncritically accept or reject information based on loyalty to their ideology. These are implied arguments rather than explicit arguments. The implication is that because the information is in-line with/goes against the person’s ideology, it must be true/false. This is a form of confirmation bias that is applied to a specific argument.

                                    <strong>Exception:</strong>
                                     There is no fallacy when one claims to follow someone or support them out of loyalty; the fallacy is committed when loyalty is considered in their evaluation of a truth claim.
      
                                </p>

                                     Be loyal to truth and reason, even if it is seen as disloyalty to an ideology.

                                 This is a slick way of having someone agree with your claim. The arguer began by introducing a common idea that many people despise—political divisiveness (thing Y). Then, made a claim (claim X) in which the person would have to show political divisiveness to reject, in effect, causing the person to substitute spite in the idea of political divisiveness for reason.

The claim is associated with the idea that his wife is "stuffing her face with food" (something Jon feels spite towards). Jon concludes that he shouldn't exercise. If Jon were using reason rather than the emotion of spite, he would find another reason not to exercise—like the fact that he is too far behind on

      The tactic is fallacious. Its basic purpose is to appeal beyond the evidence to secure acceptance. The audience is invited to assent not from conviction but out of shame and fear of being thought less knowledgeable than a mere child. The merits of the point are meanwhile overlooked.

      The fallacy is a special case of the more general fallacy of false advertisement, which consists of advance praising of your own views. Since you precede them by the information that they are known to every schoolboy and obvious to a mere child, you are scattering roses in their path. The fallacy may be perpetrated no less effectively by opening with ‘Obviously’ contentions which are by no means obvious.

      To use the fallacy effectively, you should never enter an argument without taking half the kindergarten class along for the walk. As well as the mere child and every schoolboy, you will need even a half-wit, albeit a very knowledgeable one. Every beginner should be in your posse to instruct the experts, and for sheer range of vision you will need everyone.

                                 Most applications of language, like the example above, are not taken literally, but figuratively.  However, even figurative language is a way to make an argument.  In this case, it might be used to imply that a team is no better than the least productive member of that team which is just not true.  Very often the “weakest links” fade away into the background and the strong players lead the team.

                                 “Yeah... wow, I can see that!” is the common response to a cliché that diverts critical thought by substitution of poetry, rhyme, or other rhetoric.  In fact, these are not arguments, but assertions absent of any evidence or reasons that rely on one's confusion of their emotional connection to language with the truth of the assertion.  Tell me

                                <strong>Explanation:</strong>
                                 No reason is given for why we should exterminate all baby seals.  Perhaps the reason is that they all have a virus that will spread to the human race and kill us all, perhaps exterminating all baby seals will leave more fish for humans, or perhaps exterminating all baby seals will be a way to put an end to the clubbing of baby seals—but without these or any other reasons given, we have nothing to go on except the desperation that something must be done.

                                <strong>Explanation:</strong>
                                 Desperate times don’t necessarily call for any measure over no measure.  Many times, no action is better than a bad action.  Blowing what money is left on over-priced soft drinks and what appears to be rotisserie ostrich legs, may not be a wise choice -- especially when investors are involved.

                                <strong>Exception:</strong>
                                 At times, especially in situations where time is limited, taking some action will be better than taking no action, and in the absence of better reasoning, the best available reason might have to do.  However, a reason, no matter how poor, should still be given -- not simply a conclusion.

                                <strong>Tip:</strong>
                                 Do your best to avoid situations of desperation where emotion very often takes the lead over reason.  Although not all desperate situations can be avoided, many can, by proper planning and foresight.

                                 Intuition can be defined as the sum of our experiences reflected in the feeling of knowledge that cannot be articulated. For example, if one has 30 years of experience as a firefighter, they may “know” when not to open a door in a burning building but not be able to explain why rationally. The problem is, in the moment, intuition is indistinguishable from imagination. When we get these feelings, if time permits, we should do what we can to back them up rationally.

                                Remember that considering the source is often a useful heuristic in quickly assessing if the claim is probably true or not, but dismissing the claim or accepting it as true based on the source is fallacious.

                                 In this case, Jake Tooten is the “source” who is viewed negatively (as a racist) because of his association with the organization referenced. Note that his “association” with this group says nothing about his beliefs, which makes this fallacious. It is even more fallacious due to 1) Jake being several steps removed from this organization and 2) the organization’s history of racism rather than the organization’s current position on racism.

                                 If one can demonstrate that the connection between the two characteristics that were inherited by association is causally linked, or the probability of taking on a characteristic would be high, then it would be valid. In example #1, if Delores supported the “all men should be castrated” position, we can call her an “extremist.” In example #2, if we used “murdered children” instead of “against religion,” the claim of being a “very bad man” would be justified. In example #3, if Jake appeared on the podcast titled “I am racist, and you should be too,” Callie’s claim of Jake being a racist would be justified.

                                 Lindi and Jonah are making an extraordinary claim and offering no evidence to support their claim. They are using Galileo in an attempt to get the audience to doubt their skepticism about the claim.

      Sidney: I am mere weeks away from getting my time machine to work, at which time, I will go back to 1626 and buy Manhattan from the Native Americans before the Dutch West India Company gets their greedy hands on it.

                                 Although Sidney did not use the exact example of Galileo, the fallacy is the same. Any reference to a similar story counts.

                                 Using Galileo or similar success stories to serve as effective inspirational anecdotes to encourage people to reach outside their comfort zone is not fallacious. It does not mean, however, that because they succeeded, that everyone else will or even can.

                                 Remember that for every Galileo, there are millions of cranks, quacks, and wackos, and statistically speaking, those who use the Galileo defense are one of the latter.

                                To understand how powerful priming the audience with adverse information can be, consider the Rosenhan experiment where eight mentally healthy students and researchers briefly feigned auditory hallucinations in order to get admitted to psychiatric hospitals. After admission, they said they were no longer having hallucinations and acted normally. One of the patients, who was also a student, was taking notes for the experiment which was interpreted as pathological “writing behavior” by one of the hospital staff.

      Racial/cultural profiling at airports is wrong.  An adult, middle-eastern male is just as likely to be a terrorist as a four-year-old American girl.

      The masked individual who committed the crime was about 6’2”, and took down four male security guards by hand.  It is just as likely that the criminal was a woman.

      These examples—and this fallacy—are very controversial.  Like all fallacies, arguments need to be made.  I am making an argument that PC can be a fallacy in many cases.  You might agree, you might disagree.  In either case, be prepared to argue for your position with valid reasons.

                                 At its core, being “PC” is the belief that minimizing social and institutional offense is a kind and compassionate thing to do. Don’t confuse this with the fallacy of determining the truth of a claim based on its perceived political correctness. Reality doesn’t care about social and institutional offense.

In this case, the information appears to be more of an opinion than a fact—and an investment prediction, which by its nature is risky and therefore its truth value is questionable.

                                 might not be known for its high-quality journalism and truthful reporting. However, even the most untrustworthy sources sometimes share true information. While it might be a good heuristic (rule of thumb) to be highly skeptical of any claims from such an untrustworthy source, such claims cannot be so confidently dismissed without a good reason.

                                 As long as one is claiming a degree of confidence instead of assuming true or false, there is no fallacy. Trustworthiness does impact the level of confidence one should have, but not certainty.

                                 It often occurs within religion where the standards applied to one religion or denomination to claim "truth" don't apply to arguments from other religions or denominations. In this example, the Protestant is demanding stronger "evidence" for the Catholic's claim than she would demand for herself explaining how God answers prayers.

                                  be the same, but sometimes there are legitimate different standards. For example, a president's remarks are held to a different standard than a reality television star’s remarks.

Although the claim is indeed dubious, the daughter assumes that it is wrong because of the source (her mother) and her mother's suspected motives (to get her married). So the mother must be wrong (assumption) because of her motives, and it is because of her motives that she is wrong (

                                 When others verbally attack you, take it as a compliment to the quality of your argument.  It is usually a sign of desperation on their part.

      Politician: The other guy likes to throw statistics and data at us showing how much the economy has improved. But data and statistics don't feed our children. You feel it. The economy has gotten worse! Feelings are more important than facts.

                                 There is a strong emotional appeal here accompanied by the devaluation of statistics and data (i.e., facts) in favor of feelings in order to answer an objective question: has the economy improved?

                                 Civil disobedience is just one example of something that is illegal but does not have to be immoral. Laws are created for many reasons, and only some are created for "moral" reasons (according to someone's moral code).

                                <strong>Explanation:</strong>
                                 Again, the law and one's moral code are not the same things. While there does tend to be overlap, assuming illegal is immoral or legal is moral without a rational argument connecting the two concepts, is fallacious.

                                <strong>Exception:</strong>
                                 Sometimes what is illegal is clearly immoral, and no justification is required. For example, if someone were to say, "How could you kick that old lady while laughing? That is a horrible thing to do, and you can go to jail!"

                                <strong>Tip: </strong>
                                Laws become archaic when they do not keep up with social norms and cultural changes. What was once deemed "immoral" could easily change to "moral" within a few years and vice versa. Never simply assume that laws are good and right; demand justification.

                                 This is an extreme example of a very real example that we have all seen since around early 2016. Those who passionately hate Trump, reflexively disagree with everything he says and does, associating the truth of his statement with the feelings they have for him. This is not reasonable thinking.

                                 Very often we see support for reasonable policies rejected based on the party that proposes such policies. We know this because research has been done in this area.

                                 There might be a situation where your opposition must say things that are demonstrably wrong, or they wouldn’t be your opposition. For example,

                                    <em>Bill is my opposition.</em>

                                <br/>

                            <p class="Body">
      It seems strange to suggest that because Bill is my opposition, he is wrong, but this is necessarily true if we hold that “Only those who disagree with X are my opposition” and “X is demonstrably right.” This wouldn’t make logical sense if we didn’t set the conditions so that anyone belonging to the group “opposition” would be wrong.

                                 Rejecting information from an opponent known to lie, might be a reasonable heuristic, but it is not a good critical thinking technique.

      The female staff of a large corporation holds a meeting to discuss solutions to reduce discrimination against women at the company. Men are invited but asked just to listen and not contribute to the discussion.

                                 The implication here is that men have nothing to add to the discussion. Ideas to reduce gender discrimination are independent of gender, that is, both men and women can have equally valid arguments.

                                 A requirement for this fallacy is "when the strength of the argument is independent of identity." There are arguments that do rely on identity. For example, claims of feeling and perception could be unique to certain groups.

                                 The fact that atheist ministers are about as in demand as hookers who, “just want to be friends”, does not mean that ministers believe in God just because they need a job.

                                 When you know you have something to gain from a position you hold (assuming, of course, you are not guilty of this fallacy for holding the position), be upfront about it and bring it up before someone else does.

      How do I know the adult film industry is the third largest industry in the United States? Derek Shlongmiester, the adult film star of over 50 years, said it was. That's how I know.

                                 Shlongmiester may be an industry expert, as well as have a huge talent, but a claim such as the one made would require supporting evidence.

                                 Be very careful not to confuse "deferring to an authority on the issue" with the 
                                <i>appeal to authority fallacy</i>
                                . Remember, a fallacy is an 
                                <strong>error in reasoning</strong>
                                . Dismissing the council of legitimate experts and authorities turns good skepticism into denialism. The 
                                <i>appeal to authority</i>
                                 is a fallacy in argumentation, but deferring to an authority is a reliable heuristic that we all use virtually every day on issues of relatively little importance. There is always a chance that any authority can be wrong, that’s why the critical thinker accepts facts 
                                <i>provisionally</i>
                                . 
                                <strong>It is not at all unreasonable (or an error in reasoning) to accept information as provisionally true by credible authorities.</strong>
                                 Of course, the reasonableness is moderated by the claim being made (i.e., how extraordinary, how important) and the authority (how credible, how relevant to the claim).

                                 is more about claims that require evidence than about facts. For example, if your tour guide told you that Vatican City was founded February 11, 1929, and you accept that information as true, you are not committing a fallacy (because it is not in the context of argumentation) nor are you being unreasonable.

      The 13.7 billion-year-old universe is a big conspiracy.  I read this article once where these notable scientists found strong evidence that the universe was created 6000 years ago, but because of losing their jobs, they were forced to keep quiet!

                                 Without knowing who these scientists are, or the credibility of the source of the article, we cannot verify the evidence; therefore, we should not accept the evidence.

                                At times, an accepted fact uses the same indicating phrases like the ones used for the fallacy; therefore, if the anonymous authority is actually just a statement of an accepted fact, it should be accepted as evidence.

      Tom Cruise says on TV that Billy Boy Butter is the best tasting butter there is.  Tom Cruise is awesome -- especially in MI4 when he scaled that building with only one suction glove; therefore, Billy Boy Butter is the best tasting butter there is!

                                 Tom Cruise might be awesome, and perhaps he really does think Billy Boy Butter is the best tasting butter there is, but Tom is no more an authority on the taste of butter than anyone else; therefore, to accept the claim without any other evidence or reason is fallacious.

      Mike Seaver from that 80’s sitcom, “Growing Pains”, is really cool.  He is now a born-again Christian and apologist for the faith.  Therefore, you should really believe what he has to say!

                                 Mike Seaver is awesome, but Kirk Cameron, the actor that plays that character?  Even if Kirk were super duper (which he might be, I don’t know him), his views on the truth of religion are equally valid as yours, or anyone else's who determines what he or she considers to be the truth through faith.

                                 Some celebrity endorsements are authentic, where the celebrities are motivated by the love of the product itself, not the huge check they are getting for pretending to like the product.  When these products are directly related to their celebrity status, then this could be seen as a valid (but not sufficient) reason for wanting the product.
    
                            </p>

                                 Most of us begin our lives seeing our parents as the ultimate authority, and we experience their wrath when we question that authority.  Unfortunately, this bad habit is carried over into adulthood where we replace our parents with a coach, a boss, a teacher, a commander, or a god.  Rather than question, we blindly follow.  This fallacy has probably resulted in more deaths, pain, suffering, and misery than all others combined.

      Your honor, the Bible clearly says that psychics, wizards, and mediums are to be stoned to death and that it is our responsibility to do so (Leviticus 20:27).  Therefore, I had every right to try to stone Dianne Warwick, and her psychic friends, to death.

                                , “We follow orders, son. We follow orders or people die. It's that simple. Are we clear?”  I have never served in the military, so I cannot say how far I would go when just, “following orders”.  I wouldn’t want anyone to die because I questioned orders, yet I wouldn’t want anyone to die because I followed orders blindly.  I guess this is why I am not in the military.

                                 Moral reasoning is difficult, and the consequences of making poor moral decisions can be traumatic, but the more experience you have with moral reasoning, the better you will get at it. Don’t allow an authority to rob you of this growth opportunity.

                                 Armondo may be right, but the dictionary is not the final authority on all issues, especially social behavior.  More modern usage, especially in a high school setting, takes precedence in this case.

                                 Yes, it is true "fantastic" was once most commonly used as existing only in the imagination, but common use of this word has a very different definition.

      The fallacy of non-anticipation consists of supposing that everything worth doing or saying has already been done or said. Any new idea is rejected on the grounds that if it were any good, it would already be part of current wisdom. Proposals are rejected because they have not been anticipated.

      The central assumption of the fallacy is unwarranted. Progress is made on several fronts, including the scientific and the social. New ideas are constantly being adopted, and there is no justi-fication for supposing that our ancestors would have found them all. The presumption that they did intrudes irrelevant material into the argument.

      You will find the fallacy extraordinarily useful in resisting trends towards emancipation. After all, if there were any merit in having women and children participate in decisions, would it not have been discovered long ago? The same approach will help you to stand up against independent holidays, dining out, taking exercise or eating courgettes.

                                    <i> naturalistic fallacy</i>
                                     can be seen as a subset of the 
                                    <i>appeal to nature</i>
                                    , or a more specific version that makes a moralistic value claim rather than the more generic claim of goodness. For example, saying that cocaine is good for you because it is natural is an example of the 
                                    <i>appeal to nature</i>
                                    . This has nothing to do with morality, but with health. Saying that polyamorous behavior (having multiple sexual partners) is morally good because it seems to be in line with our natural tendencies is an example of the 
                                    <i>naturalistic fallacy</i>
                                    . If one were to say that the first example was an example of the 
                                    <i>naturalistic fallacy</i>
                                    , they would be incorrect. If one were to argue that the second was an example of the 
                                    <i>appeal to nature</i>
                                    , they wouldn't be wrong (if they are equating moral actions with goodness), but they could be more accurate. Just as some dogs are Great Danes but not all dogs are Great Danes, some appeals to nature can be naturalistic fallacies, but not all appeals to nature are naturalistic fallacies.

                                 The price of $20k was a reasonable book value for the car, where the price of $1 was an unreasonable extreme.  The fact is the car is worth about $20k -- thinking the car is worth $1 or $1,000,000, won’t change that fact

      Ok, I am willing to grant that there might not be angels and demons really floating around Heaven or hanging out in Hell, but you must grant that there has to be at least one God.  Is that a fair compromise?

                                 There is no compromise when it comes to truth.  Truth is truth.  If there are angels, demons, and God, there are angels, demons, and God.  If there aren’t, there aren’t.  Compromise and splitting the difference work fine in some cases, but not in determining truth.

                                <strong>Explanation:</strong>
                                 Anyone who believes in virgin births does not have empirical evidence for his or her belief.  This is a claim accepted on faith, which is an individual and subjective form of accepting information, that should not have any effect on your beliefs.  Don’t forget that there was a time that the common beliefs included a flat earth, earth-centered universe, and demon possession as the cause of most illness.

                                <strong>Exception:</strong>
                                 Sometimes there are good reasons to think that the common belief is held by people who do have good evidence for believing.  For example, if virtually all of earth scientists accept that the universe is approximately 13.7 billion years old, it is wise to believe them because they will be able to present objective and empirical evidence as to why they believe.

                                <strong>Tip:</strong>
                                 History has shown that those who break away from the common beliefs are the ones who change the course of history.  Be a leader, not a follower.

      Let me start by thanking the wonderful people of this town for hosting this great event.  I would be honored to call you all my friends.  As friends, I want to tell you that streaking should be legalized.

                                 Buttering up the audience is actually a technique that is suggested—because it is effective.  If you know your argument is weak, and compensate by laying on the charm, you are guilty of this fallacious tactic.  If you are letting the charm affect your decision, you are also committing the fallacy.
    
                            </p>

                                 If the argument being made is directly related to the charm of the arguer, as in arguing that he or she would be the better host for a new show where charm does matter, then no fallacy has been committed.
    
                            </p>

                                <strong>Tip:</strong>
                                 If you are a natural charmer don’t be afraid to use it—just not at the expense of valid claims and strong evidence.

                                 Here the person making the argument is appealing to the 
                                <i>tradition</i>
                                 of the common folk.

                                <strong>Exception:</strong>
                                 If the “common folk” appeal is made in addition to valid reasons, then it is not a fallacy, although I would argue it is cheap pandering that many people can easily detect.

                                <strong>Tip</strong>
                                : If you are tempted to appeal to some folk, appeal to the folk that made the world a better place. Not only do people love inspirational stories, but these stories are also powerful motivators. Just be sure to use this technique in addition to reason, not in place of it.

      A 2005 Gallup Poll found that an estimated 25% of Americans over the age of 18 believe in astrology—or that the position of the stars and planets can affect people's lives.  That is roughly 75,000,000 people.  Therefore, there must be some truth to astrology!

                                Politically ideological individuals on social media consistently post quotes, articles, and stories about the heroes on their side of the political spectrum and villains on the other side in an attempt to influence public perception of their political adversaries.

This representation triggers people’s availability bias resulting in an inaccurate view of police in general. At the same time, FOX News will report on hero cops who save babies, get killed in the line of duty, and replace broken refrigerators for senior citizens. Neither of these portrayals is typical or a strong representation of police in general.

                                 There is no question that imposters exist. It is not uncommon that political rivals will pretend to be the worst of the other group with the goal of damaging the other group’s reputation. The problem here is that Garry Godznguns has no evidence to back up his claim, and there is plenty of evidence to the contrary that white supremacists and white nationalists overwhelmingly support Trump.

                                <strong>Explanation:</strong>
                                 While it is true that the guy arrested was a white nationalist who admitted vandalizing to make the protesters look bad, this was one case out of thousands. There is video documentation of known activists advocating for looting, vandalism, and even arson. The evidence strongly suggests the majority of destruction is not due to the imposters.

                                 This is a fallacy contingent upon evidence. If enough evidence exists that the majority of the group outliers in question are imposters, then there is no fallacy.

                                 The imposter fallacy is often committed with the deceptive sharing fallacy when one shares a one-off story about an actual imposter.

      While humour entertains and enlivens discussion, it also distracts. The fallacy does not lie in the use of humour but in its employment to direct attention away from the rights and wrongs of the matter in hand. A joke might win an audience, but it does not win an argument.

      The hustings heckler is the great exponent of this fallacy. His warblings accompany parliamentary election meetings, often drowning out any reasoned argument for the very good reason that they are a lot more interesting and quite often of a higher intellectual level. A few of them achieve the immortality of the book of quotations as ‘anonymous heckler’, especially if their interjection has prompted an even better reply from the candidate. Lloyd George, Winston Churchill and Harold Wilson all showed adroitness at turning a diversionary joke back upon its user.

      Often cited as a classic of irrelevant humour is the joke by Bishop Wilberforce when debating evolution against Thomas Huxley. Pouring scorn on evolution, the bishop asked Huxley:
    </p>
                            <p>
       
    </p>

      The problem for the user of rational argument is that a guffaw is as difficult to refute as a sneer. The audience enjoys the entertainment more than the argument. A speaker for a religious sect would regularly invite his audience to supply any biblical quotation which conflicted with his view of things. When members of the audience obliged, as they often did, he would always reply:
    </p>
                            <p>

      Those who set out upon the trail of public debate should carry a knapsack full of custom-built jokes ready to toss before an audience in times of need. At the very least, the wave of mirth washing over your victim slightly lowers his authority, even while it gives you time to think.

                            <p>
      The ability to produce irrelevant humour on the spur of the moment is a product of wit and experience. Many years spent in the debating chamber of a university will sharpen your ability to think on your feet. The joke need not even be a clever one if delivered with style. I once saw a speaker making a perfectly valid point about sales to authoritarian states of airplanes which could carry nuclear weapons. He was floored by an interjection which suggested that wheelbarrows could do the same.

                                 Mike made one claim: that he does not believe in any gods.  From that, we can deduce a few things, like he is not a theist, he is not a practicing Christian, Catholic, Jew, or a member of any other religion that requires the belief in a god, but we cannot deduce that he believes we are all here by accident, nature is chance, and the universe created itself.  Mike might have no beliefs about these things whatsoever.  Perhaps he distinguishes between “accident” and natural selection, perhaps he thinks the concept of design is something we model after the universe, perhaps he has some detailed explanation based on known physics as to how the universe might have first appeared, or perhaps he believes in some other supernatural explanation.  Regardless, this was a gross mischaracterization of Mike’s argument.

                                 At times, an opponent might not want to expand on the implications of his or her position, so making assumptions might be the only way to get the opponent to point out that your interpretation is not accurate, then they will be forced to clarify.

                                , which is a productive technique in argumentation where the one evaluating the argument makes the strongest case for the argument, assuming the best intentions of the interlocutor. This technique prevents pointless, time-wasting bickering and demonstrates respect for both the interlocutor and the process of critical argumentation. Consider the following dialog:

                                 If you are accused of special pleading, take the time to consider honestly if the accusation is warranted.  This is a fallacy that is easy to spot when others make it yet difficult to spot when we make it.

                                 is committed when one claims, based on past experience, contradictory evidence or claims must be rejected. It is treating the heuristic of induction like an algorithm. The name comes from the claim that “all swans are white” because nobody has ever seen a black swan before... until they did. The reasonable position to hold, assuming you existed in a pre-black-swan world, would be that “all swans that we currently know of are white.” Leave room for discovery unless it has been demonstrated that the contradictory evidence, or claims cannot possibly exist or such claims would be impossible. For example, claiming “all triangles have three sides” is both accurate and reasonable.

                                 is a cleverly-named variation of the appeal to ignorance where the absence of evidence is the result of the claim made being false. Consider the argument, “all toupées look fake; I've never seen one that I couldn't tell was fake.” The reason the person has never seen one they couldn’t tell was fake is because when they did see one they couldn’t tell was fake, they couldn’t tell was fake. The same goes for penile enlargements and boob jobs.

                                 is a specific claim stating that the reason we cannot prove something is because “it is a mystery.” Rather than question if the claim is true, we accept that it is true and forego any more investigation by writing it off as a mystery. Why is it that I smell just fine after working out, but everyone else thinks I stink? It’s a mystery!

                                 Since we use alcohol to clean viruses from our skin, it might be “common sense” that it would clean our insides too. But this is not the case. First, the alcohol needs to be high concentration, like 60% or more to be effective. Second, it does nothing to kill a virus in your body. Third, Don does need evidence if he is trying to convince Tony he is right, and he should demand evidence for himself before engaging in a risky behavior because of what he believes is “common sense.”

                                 FlatSam is attempting to justify his implied argument (the earth is flat) by appealing to “common sense.” He appears to be offering a reason (i.e., people on the bottom would fall off), but that reason is itself a claim “supported” by the appeal to common sense.

                                 What is "common sense" to one might not be to another. It is possible one might not accept something that is "common sense," so it could be argued that the error in reasoning falls on the person rejecting the assertion of common sense.

It isn't until Marty provides the Doc with extraordinary evidence (how he came up with the Flux Capacitor) that the Doc accepts Marty's claim. Given the nature of Marty's claim, it could be argued that Doc's dismissal of Marty's claim (although technically fallacious) was the more reasonable thing to do than entertain its possibility with good questions.

                                Claims of knowing the mind of God are highly dubious. While we cannot rule out "divine revelation," we would need to weigh that possibility against the likelihood of a false belief.

                                <strong>Explanation:</strong>
                                 Larry may be an ass. He might have done many bad things. Heck, he might have even have ripped the “do not remove under penalty of law” tag off his mattress. However, to make claims of “pure” evil, one would have to be Larry. While making absolute claims about a person such as being “pure evil” might just be hyperbole, if we take the claim at face value, knowing the claim to be true would require the kind of omniscience reflected in this fallacy.

                                 "Seems impossible" is not "impossible." It might be possible that someone actually has the detailed knowledge they claim. We need to keep that option open when thinking probabilistically.

                                 By simply adding an “I believe” to non-factual arguments and claims, you can avoid many fallacies and be more honest while exercising more humility.

                                 Refusal to share evidence is not necessarily evidence for or against the argument. Silent Bob’s silence does not mean he took the keys.  Perhaps he did, or perhaps he knows who did, or perhaps he saw a Tyrannosaurus eat them and was threatened by the king of the pixies not to say anything, or perhaps he just felt like not answering.

                                <strong>Explanation:</strong>
                                 The reason this technique works so well, is because 
                                <i>imagined reasons are often more persuasive than real reasons</i>
                                .  If someone wants to be convinced, this technique works like a charm.  However, to the critical thinker, this will not fly.  Silence is not a valid substitute for reason or evidence.

                                <strong>Exception:</strong>
                                 Generally speaking, absence of evidence is not evidence; however, there are many cases where the 
                                <i>reason</i>
                                 evidence is being held back can be seen as evidence.  In the first example, prompting Silent Bob to share a reason for his silence could result in a statement from Silent Bob that can be used as evidence.

                                <strong>Tip:</strong>
                                 Silence can be very powerful. In public speaking, knowing when to pause and let the audience digest what you said helps them comprehend your message. In argumentation, a pause after making a solid point can increase the odds your interlocutor(s) will accept the point.

                                 The fallacy is in the implied claim that the argument needs no evidence or explanation because it is "self-evident."

                                 This fallacy depends on the claim of “self-evidence” not being self-evident. A claim that it reasonably self-evident would not be fallacious:

                                 If you can't explain something, that doesn't mean you are dealing with something that is self-evident; it could just be your failure to explain something.

                                 “Because I said so” is not a valid reason for why a friend can’t sleep over.  Maybe the real reason is that sleepovers give mom a headache.  Maybe mom wants Trebor to go to bed early because he is cranky the next day if he doesn’t, or perhaps David is just a little brat that drives mom crazy.

                                 In this case, it is clear that there is some underlying reason about which Slick Rick does not want the prospect to know.  This reason, almost certainly, has something to do with the fact that Slick Rick can go lower if needed.

                                 There is really no exception to this rule in argumentation or serious discussion.  Perhaps this is acceptable in situations where you have the authority to choose not to make an argument out of a command, like in a parent-child relationship—or perhaps your significant other has planned a surprise for you, and the “you’ll see” is meant to deflect your inquiry for your own benefit.

                                 Don’t let yourself off the hook with “just because” excuses.  Keep asking yourself, “what is the real reason?”  The answer could uncover an issue that needs your attention.

                                 It should be obvious that reason and logic are not being used, but rather “faith”.  While Tom might be right, there is still no valid reason offered.  The problem also arises in the vagueness of the

                                 Atheist and theist debate often reduces to the concept of faith, sometimes after many hours. It is often a good idea to start with the question, “Is faith a reliable method to know things?”

                                 I heard from Suzi who told Tanya who told Jennifer that Marci simply thought Steve was a jerk but fed him the classic break up line, “it’s not you, it’s me.” Steve, being the alpha male he is, couldn’t deal with this psychological trauma of not having a firm answer to why Marci didn’t want to be with him, so based on the fact that Marci once commented that a supermodel had “pretty eyes,” Steve put the issue to rest by writing Marci off as a lesbian. Steve discovered that calling Marci a lesbian was actually just him projecting his own homosexual desires on Marci. Today, Steve is living happily with his partner, Raúl, and their white Persian cat, Mr. Muffins.

                                 Unfortunately, unsolved crimes are bad politically for those in charge and based on the number and percentage of false arrests, it is clear that appealing to closure has some serious consequences for many innocent people.

                                 It has been stated elsewhere that "agree to disagree" falls under the 
                                <i>appeal to closure</i>
                                . This is not the case because agreeing to disagree does not mean that either party is accepting the evidence of the other, in fact, it's the opposite. People can agree to "move on" or "table the issue," for many logical reasons. This is similar to negotiation and compromise. When people compromise, they usually do not agree to accept evidence they wouldn't otherwise accept. For example, if an atheist and theist are debating the existence of the Biblical God, they wouldn't say, "Okay, I'll agree that some kind of creator god exists if you agree that this god does not currently interfere in the universe."

                                 Remember that justice is a subjective term. When people cry “justice,” they often have created a narrative with very clear heroes and villains, when the truth is far more often unclear.

                                 What do the "same rights" mean? Before gay marriage, men had the right to marry women, and women had the right to marry men. A man marrying a man is a different form of the "right of marriage" and needs to be argued as such. Again, there are many excellent arguments for gay marriage, but this isn't one of them.

                                 There is quite a bit of subjectivity in the analysis of this fallacy. Is what is made equal, “clear?” Is this equality supported by the argument? Consider the following:

      Unless we are talking about two or more of the same thing (i.e., A=A), then we really mean “equal in some way.” Although not explicitly stated, “equality” is referring to having human rights, which seems pretty clear. The right to marriage and family is a universal human right, so this is supported by the argument.

                                 Don't get outraged when one questions what you believe should be "equal." Very often, either you really mean "similar" or you and your opponent have different concepts of what exactly should be equal.

                                <strong>Explanation:</strong>
                                 Astrology is a pseudoscience that claims divine information about human affairs and terrestrial events by studying the movements and relative positions of celestial objects. Starbeam is almost certainly experiencing a host of cognitive biases, including the 
                                <em>confirmation bias</em>
                                , where she notices the things that go wrong and ignores all that goes right on the days she forgets to read her horoscope. There is also likely some s
                                <em>elf-fulfilling prophecy</em>
                                 going on where she interprets things that happen to her in a negative light, allowing her to maintain the belief in the power of horoscopes. Starbeam is committing the pragmatic fallacy because she is claiming astrology is true due to her “evidence” that horoscopes work for her.

                                <strong>Example #2:</strong>
                                 People all over the world under different religions that believe in all kinds of gods claim that their particular religion is true because of how believing in their religion makes them feel, the practical benefits they get from being a member of that religion (e.g., community support, social programs, etc.), their belief that they are loved, and more.

                                <strong>Explanation: </strong>
                                All of these reasons as to why religion “works” might be sufficient for why believing in a religion can be good  but these reasons do not address the truth-claims the religion makes about the existence of gods, angels, an afterlife, a soul, and similar claims of existence.

                                <strong>Exception:</strong>
                                 This is not a fallacy when what is claimed to be true is the fact that something “works,” and works is defined subjectively (i.e., works for the person and not for everyone). For example, it is fair to say that prayer “works” when “works” is defined as giving (some) people a sense of peace and comfort.

                                 When the data does exist, especially when it is empirically verified, but you just don't know what it is, it is acceptable to stick with your hypothesis and admit you don’t know the missing data off hand, but you can get it.  For example:

      Bill the Eye Guy: The development of the eye is monophyletic, meaning they have their origins in a proto-eye that evolved around 540 million years ago. Multiple eye types and subtypes developed in parallel. We know this partly because eyes in various animals show adaption to their requirements.

                                 Yes, the evolution of the eye is confusing to non-biologists and those who are not familiar with evolutionary theory and natural selection. But the complexity of this argument is not a reason to reject it or find it less credible than a simpler claim (e.g. Zeus created eyes from clay).

                                 It is the job of the arguer to make the argument as clear as possible, and use language and terms that the audience can understand. This is a major problem in science communication. The

                                 often leads to those trying to explain a complex topic in such a way where they assume the audience has as much knowledge in the fields as they do. If your audience fails to understand your argument, don't blame the audience;  explain your argument differently.

                                     Surely, we can examine the liquid and see if it at least changes chemically, can we not?  No.  Because transubstantiation is not about a physical or chemical change, but a change in “substance” -- which, of course, is not a material change and, therefore, impossible to falsify.  Furthermore, the claim is not that it “might be” happening, but it certainly is happening, adding to the fallaciousness of the claim.  The only evidence for this is some ambiguous verses in the Bible -- so ambiguous that over a billion Christians don’t subscribe to the belief that transubstantiation occurs.  So we have

                                 is similar, but the argument does not have to contain a fallacy -- it could just be a bad argument with bad evidence or reasons.  Bad arguments do not automatically mean that the conclusion is false; there can be much better arguments and reasons that support the truth of the conclusion.

However, if they are using fallacious arguments as a form of deception, this is a strong indicator of acting in bad faith.

                                  Tim is not like normal people when it comes to work—he is part of the minority who dream big and follow their dreams.  Tim might make it big, or he might not.  Without the Tim's of the world, the normal people would have no place to get a "real job."

                                <strong>Exception:</strong>
                                 There are circumstances where eccentric or unusual behavior is clearly problematic. These are situations where even slight deviations from the norm have been demonstrated to have negative results, and the implied “badness” of the behavior needs no justification.
    
                            </p>
                            <p class="Body" style="padding-left: 40px">

                                    <em>My dad got arrested again sunbathing naked in a public park while tripping on acid... during a snowstorm. That’s not normal.</em>

                            <p class="Body">
      Another exception is when "normal" is used in such a way to balance negative social behavior.  For example, a mother may yell at her misbehaving child to "act normal" at a school open house.  There is no implication here that being "normal" is the ideal behavior, just an immediate and realistic improvement from the current behavior.

                                <strong>Tip:</strong>
                                 For the most part, being "normal" or "average" is nothing to be proud of.  Be better than average.

                                 Restating the same claims, even rearranging the words or substituting words, is not the same as making new claims, and certainly does not make the claims any more true.

                                 Repetition can be a good strategy when your interlocutor does not seem to be acknowledging your point. Rather than repeat yourself, rephrase and repeat. Make your same point but in a different way.

                                 is committed when one attempts to define “good” as anything other than itself. The philosopher G. E. Moore (1873-1958) argued that it is a mistake to try to define the concept “good” in terms of some natural property (thus, the name “naturalistic”). Defining the concept “good,” Moore argued, is impossible since it is a simple concept; a concept that cannot be defined in terms of any other concept. Not all philosophers agree that this is a fallacy. Some have argued that ethical terms, such as “good” can be defined in nonethical natural terms. They believe that ethical judgments directly follow from facts, i.e., it is possible to argue from a fact to a value.

                                     If we break this down, we can say the claim is that homosexuality (X) is not normal (X is not). We are arguing that homosexuality is morally wrong (X ought not to be) because it is not normal (X is not). The claim that homosexuality is not normal is based on defining normality as “commonly occurring.” We can see the flaw in this argumentation through a simple analogy: lying, cheating, and stealing are normal (in that most people do it at some time in their lives), but this doesn’t make those actions morally good.

                                     If we break this down, we can say that the claim that nature gives people diseases and sickness is a declaration of what is (i.e., a natural property of the world). From this, we are deriving an ought (i.e., we ought not interfere...). The wording and order of these arguments can be confusing, but remember that the underlying fallacy here is the deduction of an ought from an is.
      
                                </p>

        We go against nature (or what is) all the time. We cannot sometimes use nature as a moral baseline and at other times condemn her for her careless attitude and indifference toward the human race.

                                     While, morally speaking, adultery and philandering may be wrong, this has no bearing on the biological aspect of the desire or need. In other words, what we shouldn’t do (according to moral norms), is not necessarily the same as what we are biologically influenced to do. Also note that moral judgments are more commonly stated as facts (e.g., “philandering is wrong”) than expressed as “oughts” (e.g., “philandering ought to be wrong”). This causes people to confuse the naturalistic and moralistic fallacies.

      I have already paid a consultant $1000 to look into the pros and cons of starting that new business division.  He advised that I shouldn’t move forward with it because it is a declining market.  However, if I don’t move forward, that $1000 would have been wasted, so I better move forward anyway.

                                <strong>Explanation:</strong>
                                 What this person does not realize is that moving forward will most likely result in the loss of much more time and money.  This person is thinking short-term, not long-term, and is simply trying to avoid the loss of the $1000, which is fallacious thinking.

                                 There are ministers, priests, pastors, and other clergy all around the world who have invested a significant portion of their lives in theology, who can no longer manage to hold supernatural beliefs -- who have moved beyond faith.  Hundreds of them recognize those sunk costs and are searching for the best way to move on (see 
                                <a href="http://www.clergyproject.org/">http://www.clergyproject.org</a>
                                ) whereas many others cannot accept the loss of their religious investment, and continue to practice a profession inconsistent with their beliefs.

                                <strong>Explanation:</strong>
                                 Of course, the clergy who have not moved beyond faith and are living consistently with their beliefs have not committed this fallacy.
    
                            </p>
                            <p class="Body">
                                      
                                <strong>Exception:</strong>
                                 If a careful evaluation of the hypothetical outcomes of continued investment versus accepting current losses and ceasing all further investment have been made, then choosing the former would not be fallacious.
    
                            </p>
                            <p class="Body">

                                 Is there any part of your life where you continue to make bad investments because you fear to lose what was already invested? Do something about it.

                                 “Thanks for that!” is the usual sarcastic response to this fallacy.  Of course, had we known about the accident, the main road would have been the better choice—but nobody could have reasonably predicted that accident.  It is fallacious, and somewhat pointless, to suggest that we “should have” taken the other way.

      Judas was an idiot to turn Jesus over to the authorities.  After all, he ended up committing suicide out of guilt.

                                 It is easy for us to blame Judas as people who know the whole story and how it played out.  We have information Judas did not have at the time.  Besides, if Judas never turned in Jesus, and Jesus was never killed, but died while walking on water as an old man after tripping over a wave, would Christianity exist?

                                Practice forgiveness. We all make mistakes, and most of us learn from our mistakes and become better people. Don’t be so quick to crucify someone for something they did in the past, especially if you are doing so to virtue signal.

                                 Perhaps people are mean to Freddie because Freddie is mean to others, and it’s Freddie’s behavior that is resulting in the “mean” behaviors of others (this is known as a 
                                <em>self-fulfilling prophecy</em>
                                ). Freddie is projecting his experience, which is unique to him, onto the world at large. He is insisting that other people see humanity the way he does. We don’t deny that Freddie is experiencing the world in the way he is; we just don’t accept that Freddie’s experience represents objective reality. To accurately determine if the world is, indeed, made up of “people who are mostly nasty,” we would need to conduct research using the scientific method.

                                 Simply overusing acronyms is not the problem here; it's the deliberate overuse for the purpose of making people think the speaker is very knowledgeable in this area, or perhaps to use terms the audience is unaware of, making the audience think they need the consulting service more than they thought they did.

      Am I good at public speaking? Let's see. I have a CC, AC-B, AC-S, AC-G, CL, AL-B, AL-S, and a DTM. What do you think?

                            <p class="Body">
                                      
                                <strong>Explanation:</strong>
                                 These are all designations from Toastmasters International. In fact, many of them have more to do with leadership than speaking, but the average audience member would never know that. Besides, getting all these awards just means the person did the work needed, not that they are necessarily good at public speaking—kind of like certificates given out in fifth-grade gym class to all the kids who do more than six sit-ups.

                                 "Excessive" is subjective. Acronyms and abbreviations are perfectly acceptable in many situations.

                                 Don't be so quick to assume nefarious intentions. Sometimes people simply are unaware that they are overusing this type of language.

      Max: If you’re not a witch, you have nothing to fear.  If you’re not a witch, you are not made of wood; therefore, you will sink and drown after we tie you up and throw you in the well.  If you do float, then you are made of wood, you are a witch, and we will hang you.

                                 The fact that Teri could not explain something, does not make it unexplainable. Later, it might be revealed that a family member was playing a trick and tied a string to the stuffed animal. Maybe Teri will read about a slight earthquake that happened at the same time. Maybe Teri will later discover that there is a rat in her room that made a home in her stuffed animals. The point is, what is currently unexplained is not necessarily unexplainable.

                                 The psychology behind conspiracy theories is quite complex and involves many different cognitive biases and fallacies discussed in this book.  In general, people tend to overlook the incredible improbabilities involved in a large-scale conspiracy, as well as the potential risks for all involved in the alleged cover-up.  In the above examples, those who stick with a literal interpretation of the Bible often experience 
                                <i>cognitive dissonance</i>
                                , or the mental struggle involved when one’s beliefs contradict factual claims.  This cognitive dissonance causes people to create conspiracy theories, like the ones above, to change facts to match their beliefs, rather than changing their beliefs to match facts.

      FACT: On average, 150,000 people die every day around the world. It is crazy to panic about a virus that, at its peak, was killing 8,000 people per day. But what else can be expected from a moron like you who rejects facts?

                                <strong>Explanation:</strong>
                                 It is a fact that, on average, 150,000 people die every day around the world. It is also a fact that at its peak in the spring of 2020, the Coronavirus was killing about 8,000 people per day. What hasn't been established is what justifies "panic." "Panic," or perhaps more accurately "serious concern," can be justified in many other ways besides the total number of historical deaths. Given this, it doesn't follow that it is "crazy to panic." Further, saying or writing "FACT," followed by an accusation of rejecting the fact, makes this more fallacious than a standard non-sequitur.

                                <strong>Example #2:</strong>
                                 In May of 2020, it was common to hear accusations of "anti-science" hurled at people who wanted the country to reopen after being closed due to the Covid-19 pandemic.
    
                            </p>
                            <p class="Body">
                                      
                                <strong>Explanation: </strong>
                                "Anti-science" is similar to "anti-fact." There are many facts that point to ways the virus could spread, and reopening the country would unquestionably increase the odds that the virus would spread. Science doesn't make value judgments, however. For example, would an extra X number of deaths per week justify people getting back to work? Science 
                                <em>informs</em>
                                 political decisions such as these; it doesn't answer them. It can be perfectly consistent to agree with the science (facts) and still reject the argument that we are reopening the country "too soon."

                                <strong>Exception:</strong>
                                 If there is no accusation of rejecting facts, we might have a non-sequitur, but not a fact-to-fiction fallacy. It is not unreasonable to state a fact such as the 150,000 deaths per day stat, then ask why we are taking the actions we are for just 8000 deaths? These kinds of questions are likely to lead to answers that expose the nuance of the arguments.

                                <strong>Tip:</strong>
                                 Be careful not to read too much into facts. Our minds tend to “connect the dots” in order to support the narratives we already accept.

Almost certainly, nobody is going blind from sitting too close unless they ram their eyes into the protruding knobs. Regardless of the 
                                <em>false effect</em>
                                 (i.e., blindness), watching TV too closely (the cause) has been shown to have some adverse effects on vision, so concluding that one shouldn’t “move back” from sitting too close is fallacious.

      The Church used to claim that giving 10% of your income to the Church will free a child’s soul from Limbo into Heaven, so clearly giving money to the Church is a scam!

                                 Centuries ago, the Church did accept “contributions” to get loved ones out of “Limbo,” and it wasn’t until 2007 when the Church made it clear that Limbo was a theory and not an official doctrine of the Church, separating the Church from that belief. As for the argument, the false effect of “freeing a child’s soul from Limbo” does not warrant the conclusion that giving your money to the Church is a scam.

                                 We begin with a causal claim: The presence of police at protests cause an escalation of violence (X apparently causes Y). This is just a claim at this point and has not been established, but because there was an escalation of violence (Y is right), it is concluded that the implied claim (police should not be at protests) is true (therefore, X is right). In reality, we don’t know what caused the escalation of violence, so we cannot conclude anything about the claim. In addition, we are assuming we have agreed to the condition:

                                 It can be difficult to parse the claim that is being said to be wrong or right, in which case the causal link might be what is really being rejected. In our first example, it is fallacious to conclude that there is no reason we shouldn’t watch TV close up. We parsed this from “Watching TV that close will make you go blind.” If one is claiming that the causal claim is what is false after showing the effect to be false, then there is no fallacy.

                                 It is just as wrong to assume that the one is "out of formation" as it is to assume that all the rest must be "out of formation." While it might be statistically more probable that the one is out of formation, evidence should be sought before making any definitive claim.

                                 This type of “non-decision” or refusal to choose a side often eludes those looking for an answer but getting more of a non-answer in return.  In our example, the congressman can later choose a side based on the outcome, looking like the guy who knew the right answer all along.

                                 If you don’t have an opinion, say that you don’t have an opinion.  If you don’t know, say that you don’t know.  It’s that simple.

      Scientists cannot agree on the age of the universe.  Some say it is 13.7 billion years old, some say it is only about 13 billion years old.  That’s a difference of almost a billion years!  It should be clear that because there is so much disagreement, then the 6000-year-old universe should be carefully considered, as well.

                                 Scientists who “disagree” with the estimated age of the universe do so primarily on slightly different interpretations of the same objectively valid dating methods.  The difference is fairly minute in terms of percentage.  Suggesting 6000 years is valid is one thing, but doing so based on the difference in interpretation from mainstream science is completely fallacious.  The differences have no bearing on the truth claim of the argument (the actual age).

                                 When the difference in professional disagreement is critical, it should be carefully examined. For example, if two doctors were debating on what medicine to give a patient, and both were claiming that the other medicine would kill the patient.

                                 When experts have very different views on scientific issues, it is very often the case that one or more of them are sharing views outside their realm of professional expertise.

      Here is why I think my date never showed up: her father had a heart-attack, and she had to rush him to the hospital.  In her state of panic, she forgot her cell phone and while at the hospital she was too concerned about her dad to worry about standing me up.

                                 of nature, it could be possible that the universe is only 6000 years old.  Accepting these theories would require the abandonment or radical reformation of virtually every science we have, as well us a new understanding of the term, “fact”.  So either all of that is true, or, the Biblical creation story, like hundreds of others in cultures all around the world, are simply mythology.

                            <p class="Body">
      In inductive arguments, there is always a chance that the conclusion might be false, despite the truth of the premises. This is often referred to as “confidence level.” In any given study or poll, there is a confidence level of less than 100%. If a confidence level is 95%, then one out of 20 similar studies will have a false conclusion. If you make multiple comparisons (either in the same study or compare multiple studies), say 20 or more where there is a 95% confidence level, you are likely to get a false conclusion. This becomes a fallacy when that false conclusion is seen as significant rather than a statistical probability.
    </p>
                            <p class="Body">
      This fallacy can be overcome by proper testing techniques and procedures that are outside the scope of this book.

                                 Because we did multiple tests, i.e., compared multiple groups, statistically we are likely to get results that fall within the acceptable margin of error.  These must be disregarded as anomalies or tested further, but not taken to be meaningful while ignoring the other results.

      In our study, we looked at 100 individuals who sang right before going to bed, and 100 individuals who did not sing.  Here is what we found: Over 90% of the individuals who sang slept on their backs, and just 10% slept on their stomachs or sides.  This is compared to 50% of those who did not sing, sleeping on their backs and 50% sleeping on their stomachs or sides.  Therefore, singing has something to do with sleeping position.

                                 What this study did not report, is that over 500 comparisons were done between the two groups, on everything from quality of sleep to what they ate for breakfast the next day.  Out of all the comparisons, most were meaningless, thus were discarded—but as expected via the law statistics and probability, there were some anomalies, the sleeping position being the most dramatic.

                                 Violent crime by illegal immigrants is rarer than violent crime committed by U.S. citizens [1]. However, if the narrative a media outlet is trying to sell is that illegal immigrants are dangerous, then they can influence public opinion by inferring that one example of such violence is characteristic of the group. Expressing outrage is a way to make the influence even more effective.

      The Huffaluf Post runs a story about a Republican who assaulted a Muslim woman and told her to "go back where she came from." The story is shared millions of times and picked up by other liberal media outlets. Liberals are discussing this story on social media saying how outraged they are at Republicans for their hatred of Muslims.

                                <strong>Explanation:</strong>
                                 People and the media (biased media) tend to associate a physical or social identity to the perpetrator of a crime for the purpose of damaging the group's public perception. Why a "Republican" man? How many Republicans are assaulting Muslim women? How many Democrats are? The data are ignored for the benefit of the narrative being sold.

                                 Next time you read about a story that makes you feel outraged, direct your outrage to the individuals directly involved in the story. Don't demonize an entire physical or social identity.

                                <strong>Explanation:</strong>
                                 Once again we are dealing with confusion of probability and possibility.  The inability to, “prove”, in any sense of the word, that the ghost of Elvis is not visiting Sheila in her dreams is an impossible request because there is no test that proves the existence and presence of a ghost, so no way to prove the negative or the non-existence.  It is up to Sheila to provide proof of this claim, or at least acknowledge that actually being visited by Elvis’ ghost is just a 
                                <i>possibility</i>
                                , no matter how slim that possibility is.

                                <strong>Exception:</strong>
                                 If Ron were to say, “That is impossible”, “there is no way you are being visited”, or make some other claim that rules out any possibility no matter how remote (or crazy), then Sheila would be in the right to ask him for proof -- as long as she is making a point that he cannot know that for certain, and not actually expecting him to produce proof.

                                 If you think you are being visited by aliens, gods, spirits, ghosts, or any other magical beings, just ask them for information that you can verify, specifically with a neutral third-party that would prove their existence.  This would be simple for any advanced alien race, any god or heavenly being.  Some ideas of things to ask for:

      Kristine: That sounds like a classic case of what is called a hypnogogic hallucination with sleep paralysis. It is a dream-like state where you are not quite sleeping or awake. Your brain shuts down your ability to move and talk while you are unconscious during a normal sleep cycle, but in the case of sleep paralysis, you retain consciousness—but only for a brief time. So the odds are, you weren't really visited by aliens.

        Perhaps the greatest mind in quantum physics, Richard Feynman, once said, “I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics,” and he is probably right.  People recognize that this is perhaps the most bizarre, paradoxical, and incomprehensible area of study, that is also a respectable science.  So, if you can manage to connect the truth of your argument to quantum physics, it would be unlikely that there would be many people who know enough about quantum physics to assert that your connection is invalid. Thus your argument gains credibility out of ignorance.

                                 Bridget has a drinking problem that she is dealing with by drinking some more -- because the effects of drinking make her (temporarily) forget/not worry about the greater scale effects of her drinking.  Her reasoning that this is a good idea is fallacious.

                                 The primary role of the police is to enforce laws. David is suggesting that breaking the laws will facilitate his goal of having the police force reduced.

                                    <strong>Exception:</strong>
                                     In some cases, one may not be trying to eliminate the effect, but rather continue the cycle for some higher purpose. For example, if one learns to feel constant guilt by going to church and is relieved of that guilt by going to confession, they might find meaning in the constant “spiritual cleansing” ritual. While this might seem like irrational thinking to some, it would not fit under this fallacy.

                                    <strong>Fun Fact:</strong>
                                     People are easily persuaded to act against their self-interests. If acting against their self-interest is for some higher purpose, the behavior would not be considered irrational.

                                 is defined as having or characterized by a certainty, especially an unfounded one, that one is totally correct or morally superior. The

                                 When one conflates a reason for one's rights (constitutional or other) with what one

                                 do.  This is common among staunch defenders of "rights" who fail to see that rights are not the same as optimal courses of action.  It can be a way of attempting to hide the fact that the "should" is based on one's subjective moral values (or at least values that are not shared by the opponent) rather than a more objective law to which virtually everyone acknowledges.

      A top reality TV superstar from the hit show "Goose Galaxy" recently did an interview with GM magazine (Geese Monthly).  In this interview, he told the interviewer that, according to his beliefs, the Galactic Emperor has decreed that all MAC users are "sinful" and MAC use leads to having sex with computers.  When many MAC users and non-MAC users alike expressed their outrage at what they felt was an offensive and demonstrably false proposition, defenders of "Goose Galaxy" screamed that the TV superstar had every right to say those things as his speech is protected by the First Amendment.

                                <strong>Explanation:</strong>
                                 The claim made was that the comments were offensive and demonstrably false (as no research has been able to demonstrate that MAC use leads to having sex with computers), and the reality TV star 
                                <i>should not</i>
                                 have said those things, yet the "Goose Galaxy" supporters countered with the fact that the reality TV star had the right to say those things; therefore, he 
                                <i>should have</i>
                                .  Notice that no claim was made about rights—this is a 
                                <i>strawman</i>
                                .  The fallacy extends beyond the strawman because the defenders of "Goose Galaxy" are conflating the reality TV star's constitutional rights with the claim that he 
                                <i>should</i>
                                  have said those things.

                                <strong>Explanation:</strong>
                                 We have the same vacuity problem here, except this one is less obvious and protected by a philosophical belief system.  There is no possible way we can know what "destiny may have in store for us," thus no way to argue against it.  As a result, it is meaningless -- it is the equivalent of saying everything happens because it happens.

                                <strong>Exception:</strong>
                                 Holding beliefs that are unfalsifiable is not fallacious, especially when stated as beliefs or opinions. This becomes fallacious when an unfalsifiable claim is presented as evidence in argumentation.

                                <strong>Tip:</strong>
                                 Realize that most superstitious beliefs are centered around self-sealing or vacuous arguments, that is why so many people refuse to let go of superstitious beliefs -- because they cannot be proven false.

                                 If possible, justify your argument with evidence even if you might not have the burden of proof. The only time you might not want to do this is when it gives credibility to an outrageous accusation or claim.

They claimed "liberal civil liberties groups, feminists, homosexuals and abortion rights supporters bear partial responsibility...because their actions have turned God's anger against America." According to Falwell, God allowed "the enemies of America...to give us probably what we deserve." Robertson agreed. The American Civil Liberties Union has "got to take a lot of blame for this," said Falwell and Robertson agreed. Federal courts bear part of the blame, too, said Falwell, because they've been "throwing God out of the public square." Also, "abortionists have got to bear some burden for this because God will not be mocked," said Falwell and Robertson agreed.</em>

                                For thousands of years people have been rushing to scripture to try to make sense out of a current situation.  Without a doubt, the same verses have been used over and over again for centuries as a prophecy of a current event.  This is

      With over 31,000 verses, the probability of NOT finding a verse in the Bible that can be made to fit virtually any modern-day situation is next to zero, but what if you had 2,000 years of history to play with?  It’s not difficult to see how quickly these “fulfilled prophecies” can add up.

      Senator Elizabeth Warren was recently under attack because it was discovered that the men on her staff were paid, on average, considerably more than the women on her staff—an issue that Warren has campaigned on many times. While the facts are true (men are paid more on her staff), in many analyses, relevant data was excluded such as the criteria necessary to prove the claim that women on Senator Warren's staff were paid less than their male counterparts for equivalent work [1]. In fairness to some conservative outlets that reported this story, some used this as an example to show that there is more to the story than just raw numbers.

                                 Very often, people's ideas of God are a result of their values, not the other way around. This is made clear by the cultural shifts on moral issues that correlate with people's interpretation of the Bible (one example being 
                                <a href="http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/12/18/most-u-s-christian-groups-grow-more-accepting-of-homosexuality/">Christian's views on homosexuality</a>
                                ). Bret may genuinely believe his narrative, but it was most likely a result of the spin doctoring of another person or organization.

                                 They are situations where there is no objective truth to a view and data can be looked at in multiple ways, such as the classic "is the glass half-full or half-empty" question.

      Science enjoys an enormous prestige because it has got so many things right. In the popular imagination, the dedicated scientist in his white coat is a fount of real knowledge as opposed to mere opinion. The fact that he is using that knowledge to make Frankenstein monsters scarcely diminishes the respect for his pronouncements. Many people, anxious to invest their own views with the authority of the scientist, don the white coat of scientific jargon in an attempt to pass off their own assertions as something they are not.

      The fallacy of blinding with science specializes in the use of technical jargon to deceive the audience into supposing that utterances of a scientific nature are being made, and that objective experimental evidence supports them.

      The white coat of technical jargon is so dazzlingly clean (never having been tainted by any real scientific work) that it blinds the audience to the true merits of what is being said. Instead of evaluating contentions on the basis of the evidence marshalled for and against them, the audience recoils from the brilliance of the jargon. The fallacy is committed because this irrelevant material has no place in the argument. Just as loaded words try to prejudice a case emotionally, so does pseudo-scientific jargon try to induce an unearned respect for what is said. The proposition is the same, whatever the language; and use of language to make its acceptance easier is fallacious.

      Although blinding with science can be used in any argument, many will recognize the special domain of this fallacy as the subjects which like to consider themselves as sciences, but are not. Science deals with things from atoms to stars at a level where individual differences do not matter. The scientist talks of ‘all’ rolling bodies or whatever, and formulates general laws to test by experiment. The trouble with human beings is that, unlike rolling bodies, the individual differences do matter. Often, again unlike rolling bodies, they want to do different things. Although this might prevent us from being scientific about human beings, it does not stop us pretending to be so. What we do here is to add the word ‘science’ onto the study, giving us ‘economic science’, ‘political science’ and ‘social science’. Then we dress them in that white coat of scientific language, and hope that no one will notice the difference.

      The first rule for using this fallacy is to remember to use long words. (‘When the pie was opened, the birds commenced to sing.’) Never use a four-letter word, especially if you can think of a 24-letter word to take its place. The jargon itself is harder to master, but a subscription to New Society is a good investment. Remember that the basic function of words is to prevent communication. Their real task is to transform what is banal, trivial and easily refuted into something profound, impressive and hard to deny.

      The fallacy of blinding with science is well worth the time and trouble required to master it. The years of work at it will repay you not only with a doctorate in the social sciences, but with the ability to deceive an audience utterly into believing that you know what you are talking about.

      A runaway train takes you speeding into the distance, but unfortunately does not stop. This means that when you reach your required destination you cannot leave it, but are compelled to be taken further than you wished. The runaway-train fallacy is committed when an argument used to support a course of action would also support more of it. If you wish to stop at a particular point, you need an argument to do so.
    </p>
                            <p>
      It might well be true that lowering a highway speed-limit from 70 mph to 60 mph would save lives. That is not a sufficient argument for choosing 60 mph, however, because lowering the speed limit to 50 mph would save even more lives. And more still would be saved at 40 mph. The obvious conclusion of this run-away train is that if saving lives is the sole aim, the speed limit should be set at the level which saves the most, and this is 0 mph.
    </p>
                            <p>
      In practice the lives at risk for each proposed speed-limit have to be measured against what is achieved by the ability to travel and to transport goods rapidly. Most of our daily activities involve a degree of risk which could be reduced if we limited our actions. In practice we trade off risks against convenience and comfort. If the case for making the speed limit 60 mph is based solely on the lives which could be saved, the arguer will need additional reasons to stop at 60 mph before the runaway train of his own argument takes him to 50 mph, then 40 mph, and finally crashes into the buffers when it reaches 0 mph.

                                      People argue that since, in the UK, everyone has to pay for the country’s National Health Service, this gives the state a sufficient justification to ban smoking, because smokers suffer more illnesses. There may be good reasons to ban smoking, but the argument that the costs of the smoker’s behaviour should be imposed on others is a runaway train. Why stop there? The same argument applies to all behaviour which affects health adversely. It could be applied to the eating of saturated fats such as butter, or refined white sugar. The state could require people to exercise in order to prevent the health costs of their laziness from falling on others. If this argument is to apply only to smoking, there have to be reasons why the train stops there.

      The fallacy is often committed when someone advances a general argument for something he regards as a special case. If the argument has any merit, the listener immediately wonders why it should be limited to that case. To combat a runaway train, it is usually sufficient to point to some of the absurd stations further down the same line. If good schools are to be banned because they give children an ‘unfair’ advantage, why not prevent rich parents from doing the same by buying their children books, or taking them on foreign holidays?

      To lure people on board the runaway train, simply appeal to things which most people favour, like saving lives, aiding widows and orphans and having better-behaved children. Use the general support which such things enjoy to urge support for the one proposal you favour which might help to achieve them, even as you carefully ignore the others.

      People may employ hedging to make their contentions ambiguous, or they may use a definitional retreat to claim that their words meant something else. In the third version of this defensive type of operation, they may actually change the whole ground they were maintaining, while still claiming continuity. When people do shift the substance of what they were saying, they commit the fallacy of shifting ground.

      The deception is the source of the fallacy. Criticism of the original stance is avoided by shifting to a different one. In that the argument has taken place about the position as understood, it is irrelevant to the new position which is now claimed. Similarly a critique now has to start all over again on the new position because what has passed so far has not been centered upon it.

      The shifting sands of political fortune often coincide with the shifting ground of the fallacy. This is because of a patently absurd rule that no politician must ever change his mind about any-thing. To do so would be to admit he was wrong before, and could, by implication, be wrong now. Infallibility must, there-fore, be sustained. Shifting ground, insecure though it might look to us, provides a solid foundation for political continuity.

      Shifting ground is for defensive use. You cannot convince others of a new point with it, but you can use it to avoid it being known that you were wrong. As the victorious armies march into your territory after the struggle, they are surprised to find you at the head of them, leading the invasion. They had quite mistakenly supposed that you were head of the defense forces.

      When the round black hat first appeared it was dubbed a bowler. This was because it looked like a bowl, and because it was made by the Bowler brothers. The term ‘Thatcher’s blame’ might similarly catch on for two reasons: it was regularly used against the lady herself, and it covers all cases, just as a thatcher covers all of a roof.
    </p>
                            <p>
      In her first few years in office, Lady Thatcher was blamed for poverty and unemployment in Britain. Seamlessly this switched to blame for the culture of shameless affluence as the emerging class of yuppies flaunted their new-found wealth. She was deemed to be at fault in both cases.
    </p>
                            <p>
      The fallacy of Thatcher’s blame’ is committed when blame is attached no matter what outcome ensues. The fallacy occurs because the evidence is irrelevant when the determination of guilt precedes the outcome of their actions. Indeed, the point about ‘Thatcher’s blame’ is that it covers all the conceivable outcomes.

      If a policy is introduced first in Scotland, ahead of its application in England, the accusation is that the Scots are being used as guinea-pigs, and put at risk simply to test it. On the other hand, if the policy is introduced in England before being extended to Scotland, the charge will be made that the Scots are being left out yet again. Finally, if the policy is introduced at exactly the same time in both countries, this will be taken as evidence that the policy-makers are failing to appreciate the essential differences between England and Scotland. Heads you lose, tails you lose, and if the coin lands on its edge you also lose.

      The fallacy works well in parliament because the official opposition is supposed to oppose. ‘Thatcher’s blame’ allows them to be against whatever the government decides to do, no matter what the outcome might be. Thus anything done quickly is being ‘rushed through recklessly’, while measures which take time are tagged with ‘intolerable delays’.
    </p>
                            <p>
      The fallacy falsely pretends that a judgement is being made based on the outcome, when that negative judgement would have been applied to any outcome. It regularly appears in Britain’s tabloid press, where once a celebrity has fallen from favour any action they take is deemed to deserve condemnation. Since the opprobrium comes anyway, it expresses no real judgement on the morality or merits of the actions themselves.

                            <p>
      The fallacy is easy to use because it preys upon an instinct which would rather hear ill than good about people. After all, gossips don’t go round praising people for their righteous actions. To use it effectively, you should pour scorn on some proposed action, predicting an adverse outcome. You then introduce an alternative consequence with the words ‘And even if …’ This allows you to predict more dire consequences. Your audience will never spot that you have, like the fallacy, covered every conceivable case. If you think this too obvious, reflect that for over a century the followers of Marxism predicted disaster for capitalism, whatever outcomes it produced.

      An enthymeme is an argument with one of its stages understood rather than stated. This is all right as long as both parties accept the tacit assumption. When the unstated element is not accep-ted, we move into the territory of the fallacy.

      In this case a fallacy is committed because an important element of the argument is omitted. If both parties agree on the assumption, then it is present although unstated. If only the lis-tener makes the assumption, he may think the argument has more support that it really does. We often leave out important stages because they are generally understood, but we have to recognize that there can be disagreements about what we are entitled to assume.

                                      It is because we use enthymemes routinely to avoid labor-iously filling in the details that opportunities for the fallacy arise. The earnest caller who wishes to discuss the Bible with you will be satisfied if told ‘I’m a Buddhist’, because both parties accept the implicit fact that Buddhists do not discuss the Bible. If, however, you were to reply instead: ‘Buddhists don’t discuss the Bible’, your caller might still be satisfied, making the obvious assumption that you were a Buddhist. (Make sure though that you have a very good answer ready should you happen to meet him in church next Sunday.)

                                Unaccepted enthymemes form ready crutches for lame excuses. The listener will generously clothe them with the unstated part necessary to complete the argument, instead of leaving them to blush naked.

      The fallacy is easy to use, and will get you off the hook in a wide variety of situations. The procedure is simple. Give a general statement as the answer to an individual situation. Your audience will automatically assume the missing premise: that the general situation applies to this particular case. What people normally do in certain circumstances is only relevant to the charges against you if it is assumed that you were indeed in those circumstances. The unaccepted enthymeme will slide in as smoothly as vintage port.

      You can equally well make general assertions during a discussion about someone in particular. Your audience’s delight at gossip and determination to believe the worst in everyone will help the unaccepted enthymeme to mingle with the invited guests.

                                 The “freewill” argument has been around for thousands of years, and we may never know how free we really are to make decisions. Many philosophers recognize this problem as well as the consequences of not believing in freewill. For this reason, some suggest that we should just accept freewill as being true. While acting as if we have freewill might lead to a better outcome, actually believing freewill to be true because of the consequences is a compromise of one’s rational integrity.

                                  If the force, coercion, or threat of force is not being used as a reason but as a fact or consequence, then it would not be fallacious, especially when a legitimate reason is given with the “threat”, direct or implied.

                                <strong>Example #1: </strong>
                                Tony does not agree that every black person in America should be compensated financially for the history of slavery. Therefore, Tony is a racist.

                                <strong>Explanation:</strong>
                                 The term "racist" is an extremely pejorative term that has traditionally been associated with those holding beliefs of racial supremacy—the belief that one's race is superior to other races. By expanding the definition to include "those who don't agree with policies that benefit another race," we fallaciously equate the behavior with the label's or the group's far more malicious roots. Not only does this unreasonably characterize the person who is against the policy, but it also waters down the meaning of "racist" to the point where traditional racists are unreasonably seen more favorably because the term "racism" has been expanded to include a spectrum of far less malicious behaviors.

                            <p class="Body">
                                      
                                <strong>Example #2:</strong>
                                 Suzie and Patty went on a date. Patty told herself and her friends that she was not going to have sex on the first date, but she did anyway because she was caught up in the moment. The next day, Patty said that Suzie was very seductive, and Patty couldn't resist her advances. Patty's friends convince her that she was raped.
    
                            </p>
                            <p class="Body">
                                      
                                <strong>Explanation: </strong>
                                Patty's friends' goal was to show sympathy to Patty. They did this by giving her victim status and criminalizing Suzie's behavior by unreasonably viewing Suzie as a "rapist." Universally, if Suzie's behavior is accepted as "rape," the definition has radically changed, which not only demeans victims of "traditional" rape by associating them with those who were seduced by their date but conflates actual rapists with those who are just seductive.

                                Ricardo had a hamburger for lunch. Antonio, Ricardo's vegan friend, argues that he is a murderer.

                            <p class="Body">
                                      
                                <strong>Explanation: </strong>
                                "Murder" is traditionally defined as the unlawful killing of another human being. A cow isn't a human being, killing a cow isn't unlawful, and Ricardo didn't kill the cow he ate. It is unreasonable to put Ricardo, a guy who at a hamburger, in the same category as Jeffrey Dahmer, a guy who ate his human victims he killed. Antonio is using the term "murderer" in a fallacious attempt to associate a similar level of malice with Ricardo's behavior.

                                . Terms change and evolve as do criteria. What makes this a fallacy is a) the definition is changed substantially and b) for the purpose of condemning or criminalizing a far less malicious or deleterious behavior.

This may be good for lifting spirits, but it is antithetical to reason.

      Exceptions, of course, disprove rules. Despite this, many people confronted by a counter-example to their claim will dismiss it as ‘the exception that proves the rule’. The fallacy consists in the dismissal of a valid objection to the argument.

      The origin of the fallacy lies in the changing uses of language. The word ‘prove’, which is now taken to refer to establishing something beyond doubt, used to mean ‘test’. Something would be ‘proved’ to establish its quality, and this is the sense which has passed down to us in this fallacy. The exception puts the rule to the test and, if it is found to be a valid exception, refutes it instead of proving it in the modern sense of the word:

      There is a very loose way in which an exception can help to point to an otherwise general truth. If we all recognize an exception as remarkable, and identify it as such, then it does show that we accept that the rule which it counters does usually apply. In this sense, the one case we recognize as a freak points to the otherwise general truth:

      Even in this specialized case, the exception disproves the universal rule. The trouble with sweeping statements is that it really does take only one exception to negate them. The medieval world abounded with universal which assured people that the sun would always rise and set each day, and that there could be no such thing as a black swan. A visit to the land of the midnight sun scuppered the first one, and the discovery of black swans in Australia polished off the second. It would be pleasant for many people if they could live in a world of certainties, surrounded by huge general truths. Exceptions come baying at that cozy world like wolves at the fringes of a camp-fire. They introduce uncertainties and doubts, and the temptation there is to use the fallacy quickly to get rid of them so that we can continue as before.

      The exception that proves the rule is a fallacy beloved of those who are emphatic in their judgements. They have the world neatly divided into categories, and do not intend the irritant sand of exceptions to intrude into the well-oiled machinery of their worldview. In their smooth-running world, all pop stars are drug addicts, all feminists are lesbians and all young people are weirdos. Any honourable exceptions to the above categories are ejected with equal smoothness as ‘exceptions that prove the rule’. The great thing about this particular fallacy is that it renders your argument invulnerable to factual correction. The most embarrassing proofs that you are just plain wrong can be swallowed whole as ‘exceptions that prove the rule’, and need occasion no more than a slight pause in your declamation.

      If fallacies were assigned to the nations of the world, the argumentum ad temperantlam would be allocated to England. It is the Englishman’s fallacy. The argumentum ad temperantiam suggests that the moderate view is the correct one, regardless of its other merits, it takes moderation to be a mark of the soundness of a position.

                            <pre class="wp-block-verse">
                                The unions have asked for 6 per cent, the management have offered 2 per cent. Couldn't we avoid all the hardship and waste of a lengthy strike, and agree on 4 per cent?
                                <br/>
                                (If we did, next time the unions would demand 20 per cent and the management would offer minus 4 per cent.)

                            <p>
      The argumentum ad temperantiam appeals to a common instinct that everything is all right in moderation. Moderate eating, moderate drinking and moderate pleasures have been widely praised by cloistered philosophers without any extreme desires of their own. The ad temperantiam appeals to that upper-class English feeling that any kind of enthusiasm is a mark of bad manners or bad breeding. One shouldn’t be too keen. It helps to explain why none of them are particularly good at anything, and accounts for their steady, but moderate, decline.
    </p>
                            <p>
      The fallacy enters in because, while moderation may be a useful maxim to regulate our desires, it has no specific merit in argument. Where one view is correct, there is no rule that it will be found by taking the average or mean of all of the views expressed.
    </p>
                            <p>
      If two groups are locked in argument, one maintaining that 2+2 = 4 and the other claiming that 2+2 = 6, sure enough, an Englishman will walk in and settle on 2+2 = 5, denouncing both groups as extremists. He is correct to describe them as extremists, but incorrect to suppose that this proves them wrong.

      In countries and situations where bargaining is more common than fixed price transactions, people routinely manipulate the extremes in order to influence the idea of a ‘fair’ average. Exactly the same procedure can be used in public life, advocating an extreme position in order to pull the eventual settlement closer to your way of thinking.

      Only in England do people write books with titles like The Middle Way, elevating the argumentum ad temperantiam into a guide for public policy. The Liberal Party used to make a career of the fallacy, regularly taking up a position midway between those of the two main parties, and ritually denouncing them for extremism. The main parties, in their turn, contained this threat by bidding for ‘the middle ground’ themselves. This led the Liberals to become extremists in order to attract attention. In Britain New Labour was built upon the temperantiam. They called it the Third Way.

      When two countries are disputing the ownership of a couple of islands for example, you should be the first to leap in with the ‘one each’ suggestion. There will be plenty of British diplomats trying to beat you to it.

      Classic among schoolboy fallacies is the argument that because all horses have four legs and all dogs have four legs, so all horses are dogs. This is the simplest version of the notorious fallacy of the undistributed middle. Both horses and dogs are indeed four-legged, but neither of them occupies the whole of the class of four-legged beings. This leaves convenient room for horses and dogs to be different from each other, and from other beings which might also without any overlap be in the four-legged class. The ‘middle’ which carelessly omitted to get itself distributed is the term which appears in the first two lines of a three-line argument, but which disappears in the conclusion. The classic three-liner requires that this middle term must cover the whole of its class at least once. If not, it is undistributed.

                                All men are mammals. Some mammals are rabbits, therefore some men are rabbits.

                                (Even though the first two lines are correct, the middle term 'mam-mals' never once refers to all mammals. The middle term is thus undistributed and the deduction invalid.)

      Common sense shows why the undistributed middle is fallacious. The standard three-liner (called a ‘syllogism’) works by relating one thing to another by means of a relationship they both have with a third. Only if at least one of those relationships applies to all the third thing do we know that it is certain to include the other relationship.

      We cannot say that bureaucrats are petty tyrants just because bureaucrats are meddlesome and petty tyrants are meddlesome. It is quite possible that gin-sodden drunks are meddlesome too, but that does not mean that bureaucrats are gin-sodden drunks. (Life might be more interesting if they were.) This fallacy com-monly appears in the form of ‘tarring with the same brush.’

      The great thing about undistributed middles is that you can undistribute new ones as further ‘evidence’ in support of your previously undistributed ones. (The worst oppressors of the working class wear shoes; Jones wears shoes…)

      The expert user will take the trouble to find out which terms are distributed or undistributed. He will learn the simple rule: ‘Universals have distributed subjects, negatives have distributed predicates.’ Universals are statements which tell us about all or none of a class, and negatives tell us what isn’t so. Armed with this technical information, the expert is able to inflict upon his audience such monstrosities as:

                            <pre class="wp-block-verse">
                                All nurses are really great people, but it happens that some really great people are not properly rewarded. So some nurses are not properly rewarded.
                                <br/>
                                (It may be true, but has he given an argument? Since the middle term 'really great people' is neither the subject of a universal, nor the predicate of a negative, it is not distributed. We have here, therefore, a very complex fallacy of the undistributed middle.)

                            <p>
      Leaving aside these technical uses, the fallacy in its simple form will give hours of pleasurable success if applied systematically. You should use it to gain approval for what you favour by pointing out how it shares qualities with something universally admired. Similarly, opposing ideas can be discredited by showing what qualities they share with universally detested things.

                                      Let's use the example of automobile accidents since we have relatively good data on these. According to the 
                                <a href="http://www.NHTSA.dot.gov" target="linkedpage">National Highway Traffic Safety Administration</a>
                                , roughly 32,000 people die each year on the roads in the United States. The number of people involved in fatal accidents is roughly double that amount, meaning that about half of the people survive, and half die. Let's say that 80% of people involved in a fatal accident reach out for supernatural help. Given an even distribution among survivors and non survivors this would mean that 25,600 people who reach out for supernatural help die and 25,600 who reach out for supernatural help live to tell about it. Now we need to add in the 20% of survivors who did not reach out for supernatural help that lived: 6,400. So what we end up with is a group of 32,000 survivors, 80% of whom appear to have been saved by supernatural intervention. Of course, dead men don't tell tales, so we forget about the 80% of those who died and reached out for supernatural help and didn't get it. Because of the

      The survivorship bias is used by scammers and con artists who take advantage of the "statistically ignorant" public. One common scam is something I call the "prophetic investor." The scammer will send an e-mail to a very large group of people (say 10 million) with a claim that they have a perfect track record for picking winning investments. But they tell you not to take their word for it, let them prove it you by picking a stock a day for 7 days in a row that increases in value. Then, they say when you are convinced, call them and invest with them. Here's how the scam works:

                            <p class="Body uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="display: block; padding-left: 20px; font-style: italic">
                                      Day 1: Five different stocks are chosen, and each stock is sent to 2 million people as the winning pick. Let's say three of those stocks make money, and two don't. The 4 million people who received the stock pick that lost money are removed from the list (kind of like dying).
                                <br/>
                                <br/>
                                Day 2: Another 5 stocks are chosen. This time, each stock is only sent to the "survivors," about 1.2 million people each get a new pick. Out of that group, perhaps just two stocks are winners. That means that 2.4 million people got the winning stock: two days in a row! You can see where this is headed...
                                <br/>

                                <br/>
                                Day 7: After the final day of sending, about 100,000 "survivors" remain on the list. These are people who have been sent the winning picks 7 days in a row and are convinced that the "investor" must be legitimate. After all, what are the chances that anyone would pick 7 winning stocks in a row with that much confidence?

                                <strong>Explanation:</strong>
                                 Let's ignore the gross statistical inaccuracy of this quote for a moment (i.e., 1 out of every 100 or so Syrian refugees is not going to kill you). The actual quantitative data about how many Syrian refugees are likely to be terrorists is some number greater than zero. The downside of letting Syrian refugees in the U.S. can be measured quantitatively, perhaps your risk of getting killed by a terrorist will increase from 3.46 billion to one to 3.4 billion to one. The upside, for the most part, is qualitative, that is, cannot be measured easily. What is a human life worth? How do we measure the suffering of others? Since these cannot easily be measured, we ignore them and conclude that taking in Syrian refugees is a bad decision.

                                 While the numbers on gun violence are alarming, we can't ignore the qualitative benefits of gun ownership. When making a decision, all factors need to be considered, even if they cannot be measured quantitatively.

                                 It is possible that certain decisions do not have any qualitative components, or the qualitative components are irrelevant. For example, very often salespeople or high-end stores will attempt to sell us overpriced products or services that we can get elsewhere for 1/2 the price. They might justify their higher prices with "service," where nobody needs "service" when buying toilet paper.

                                 Qualitative factors are often measured with a degree of subjectivity, meaning that one might give different moral weight to an idea based on one's core values. Consider this before being too harsh in your judgment of others' political or religious views.

                                 This was a common argument against the banning of indoor smoking for bars and other drinking establishments.  The fear of separating smoking and drinking arose from the fear of going out of business, not from statistical data or any other evidence that would normally be deemed reasonable.  Many years later, it appears that the smoking ban had no significant impact on these kinds of establishments.

                                 It is important to note that analogies cannot be “faulty” or “correct”, and even calling them “good” or “bad” is not as accurate as referring to them as either “weak” or “strong”.  The use of an analogy is an argument in itself, the strength of which is very subjective.  What is weak to one person, is strong to another.

      Science often gets things wrong.  It wasn’t until the early 20th century when particle physics came along that scientists realized that the atom wasn’t the smallest particle in existence.  So perhaps science will soon realize that it is wrong about the age of the universe, the non-existence of a global flood, evolution, and every other science fact that contradicts the Bible when read literally.

                                 To see this fallacy, let’s put it in the logical form, using just the evolution claim:
    
                            </p>
                            <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      P1. Thinking the atom was the smallest particle was a mistake of science.

                            <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      P2. Evolution is also a mistake of science.

      C. Therefore, science thinking the atom was the smallest particle is like science thinking evolution is true.

                                      Premise two (P2) should jump out as a bold assumption, although not fallacious.  Remember, the premises don’t have to be true for the argument to be valid, but if both premises were true, does the conclusion (C) follow?  No, because of the 
                                <i>extended fallacy</i>
                                .  The reason is if evolution were false it would not be for the same reason that science thought the atom was the smallest particle.  Science “was wrong” in that case because it did not have access to the whole truth due to discoveries yet to be made at the time.  If evolution were wrong, then all the discoveries that have been made, the facts that have been established, the foundation of many sciences that have led to countless advances in medicine, would all be dead wrong.  This would be a mistake of unimaginable proportions and consequences that would unravel the very core of scientific understanding and inquiry.

For example, "Johnny, you need to better in school." Clearly, the implication here is that Johnny needs to

      There is no way those Girl Scouts could have sold all those cases of cookies in one hour.  If they did, they would have to make $500 in one hour, which, based on an 8 hour day is over a million dollars a year.  That is more than most lawyers, doctors, and successful business people make!

                                 The Girl Scouts worked just for one hour -- not 40 per week for a year.  Suggesting the extreme leads to an absurd conclusion; that Girl Scouts are among the highest paid people in the world.   Not to mention, there is a whole troop of them doing the work, not just one girl.

      Don’t forget God’s commandment, “thou shall not kill”.  By using mouthwash, you are killing 99.9% of the germs that cause bad breath.  Prepare for Hell.

                                 It is unlikely that God had mouthwash on his mind when issuing that commandment, but if he did, we’re all screwed (at least those of us with fresh breath).

                                , or reducing the argument to the absurd.  The difference is where the absurdity actually is in the argument or in the reasoning of the one trying to show the argument is absurd.

                                 People very often say stupid things.  Sometimes it is easy to reduce their arguments to absurdity, but remember, in most cases, your goal should be diplomacy, not making the other person look foolish.  Especially when dealing with your spouse—unless you really like sleeping on the couch.

      Our country is certainly in terrible shape.  Sure, we still have all kinds of freedoms, cultural diversity, emergency rooms and trauma care, agencies like the FDA out to protect us, the entertainment industry, a free market, national parks, we are considered the most powerful nation in the world, have amazing opportunities, and free public education, but still...

                                 People love stories of hope and miracles.  You won’t find stories about how someone prayed to be healed then died.  These are not the kind of stories that attract viewers and sell papers.  As a result, the spotlight fallacy makes us think the rare cases, almost certainly due to normal and necessary statistical fluctuations, seem like the norm.  Believing that they are, is fallacious reasoning.

                                 The husband is jumping to the conclusion that the house is without problems simply because the person who gets paid to sell the house did not mention any. This is fallacious reasoning.

                                      A statistician has been described as someone who draws a mathematically precise line from an unwarranted assumption to a foregone conclusion. It is not quite as bad as that, but there are innumerable statistical fallacies ready to trap the unwary and aid the unethical. The fallacy of 
                                <em>ex-post-facto</em>
                                  statistics is perpetrated when we apply probability laws to past events.

      We cannot draw too many conclusions from the low ‘probability’ of certain past events. Something has to happen, and if the range of possibilities is large, the probability of each one occurring is small. Whichever one occurs thus has a low probability. The fallacy is committed when we go on to suppose, from the occurrence of events of low probability, that something supernatural was operating:

                            </p>

                                      The probability of heads coming up four times in a row is only 1 in 16. The same is true of every other combination which might come up; only one thing is certain, that a 1 in 16 chance 
                                <em>will</em>
                                 come up if you make four tosses. The fallacy goes beyond the evidence, using statistics in an inapplicable way to point to mysterious influences where none are needed. 
                                <em>Ex-post-facto</em>
                                 statistics often appear in speculations concerning the origins of life and the universe. Exotic calculations are trotted out showing the incredible unlikelihood that things could ever have happened as they did:

      Similar claims are made of the probability of the right chemicals coming together to form life. The fact is that in our universe chemicals combine in certain ways. If they were different, no doubt different beings in a different universe would be congratulating themselves on their good fortune.

      The fallacy is a great prop for those who suppose themselves the children of destiny. Looking at the unlikely events which have led to their present position, they see the unseen but inexorable hand of fate behind them, never realizing that had things been different they could have said the same.

                                      Like most fallacies, we have the fallacious tactic by the one who shares an article, post, or meme on social media depicting a statistically rare event with the intent to manipulate public perception of the event as a common event.

      There is a strong, implied argument with the share that the event is far more common than it actually is. If the content is shared with an explicit argument claiming that the event is more common than it really is, then there is no fallacy; it is a factual error. What makes this fallacious is the implied argument that remains unsaid but clearly implied.

                                During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was much debate on reopening schools. Like with many issues, there was a strong partisan split where liberals were mostly against sending kids back to school, and conservatives were mostly for sending kids back to school. Several of my liberal friends commonly shared stories about kids getting sick, including this story posted with no comment nor argument:

                                    <em>Health officials in Georgia confirmed this week that a 7-year-old boy with no underlying health conditions has died from the coronavirus, the youngest fatality from the pandemic in the state so far.</em>

                            <p class="Body">
      Children, especially healthy children with no underlying health conditions, dying from COVID-19 is extremely rare. Sharing stories of this happening gives people the impression that it is far more common than it actually is, causing them to make important decisions based on a poor understanding of the data.
    </p>
                            <p class="Body">
                                      
                                <strong>Example #2:</strong>
                                 Some people who were adamantly against wearing masks shared the story published by the 
                                <em>New York Post</em>
                                 on May 6th, 2020, with the headline “Two Boys Drop Dead in China While Wearing Masks During Gym Class.” Ignoring the problem with causation (i.e., it has not been determined that the masks had anything to do with the deaths), the purpose for sharing the article is very clear: To attempt to vindicate the sharer’s anti-mask-wearing position. The fact is, recorded instances of people dying from wearing masks are exceptionally rare.
    
                            </p>
                            <p class="Body">
                                      
                                <strong>Exception:</strong>
                                 It may be the case that statistically rare events are also “feel good” events that have no manipulative intent, for example, sharing a story about a local child who saved his family from a gas leak. There is no implication here that kids saving their families from gas leaks is a common occurrence.
    
                            </p>
                            <p class="Body">
      A more questionable exception is the statistically rare, “feel good” event that may be shared with the intent to manipulate. An example is FOX News, with their regular posts of “hero cops” who save babies, help old ladies across the street, or save the world from intergalactic invaders. The manipulative intent is debatable. While the public does love these stories, they also counter the police brutality stories commonly posted by mainstream media.

                                 Remember the 
                                <em>principle of charity</em>
                                . If you are not confident that the sharer is implying that the event they are sharing is far more common than reality dictates, ask, “what is the reason you are sharing this?”

                                <strong>Explanation:</strong>
                                 The first question that should immediately come to mind is, how on earth can one measure morality?  With such a loose definition, it is not hard to imagine one collecting and measuring the data that only supports her desired outcome for the “numbers”.  Furthermore, what is a “huge spike?”  Visually, you can play with graphs to make numbers seem much more dramatic by not starting at zero, or by doing that little “chopped section” thing.  For example, let’s accept that last year 20% of all people were immoral.  This year it is 22%.  Not a big deal, and if shown on a graph with a vertical axis of 0% to 100%, the line connecting the 20% to the 22% would be barely inclined.  However, if shown on a graph with a vertical axis of 20% to 25%, the line connecting the 20% to the 22% would appear to be a huge spike. The same data, a very different presentation.

      Looking at that pie chart, there is a very small percentage of people who declare themselves atheist.  Therefore, atheism is not that popular of a belief.

                                 First, atheism is better described as a lack of belief.  Second, many non-believers are not even familiar with the term “atheist,” and often consider themselves Christian, Jewish, or some other religion, based on their culture and family tradition, not necessarily their beliefs.  Statistics don’t account for this.

                                 is related to this fallacy, but the fallacy rests on the person interpreting the statistics.  For example, you might be very troubled to find out that your doctor graduated in the bottom half of her class, but that is half of all the doctors in the world, and to be expected.

      In cases where there is a fixed and known set of alternatives, it is legitimate to establish the superiority of one by showing all of the others to be inferior. However, in cases where the alternatives are not fixed or known, and where absolutes rather than comparatives are sought, it is a fallacy to suppose that we argue for one by denigrating the alternatives. The fallacy is that of damning the alternatives.

      Even where there are only two alternatives, we cannot show that one is good by showing that the other one is not. Both might be equally bad. The same applies for larger groups.

      (Other teams not taken account of might enter the reckoning. Even so, if Liverpool and Manchester United were bad, it would not prove Chelsea good. It might be that all football teams are absolutely terrible.)

      The fallacy occurs because in leaving out the performance of alternatives not referred to, we exclude material which might be relevant to a decision. Second, by introducing material which denigrates others in cases where a simple judgement is required, we bring in irrelevant matter.

                            <p>
      Damning the alternatives is the fallacy of the partisan. Anxious to elevate his own village, nation, team, church, occupation, race or class, he thinks he does so by running down the others. Rupert Brooke used the fallacy for humorous effect in his famous poem, ‘The Old Vicarage, Grantchester’. Amongst the praise for Grantchester itself are sandwiched adverse comments on the other villages in the area. He tells us:

      The fallacy will give you hours of innocent fun (and a fair amount of guilty fun) in running down the alternatives to what you are proposing. We appear to have a kind of double vision which leaves us short-sighted on virtue but hawk-eyed for faults. To you this is but opportunity. When you pick on a couple of alternatives and expose their imperfections, the audience will be turning those defective eyes away from your own proposal. They will assume that you would not run down everything else as mean, foolish, wrong and wicked if your own ideas were no better. They will be mistaken.

      The Bible clearly says, “Thou shall not bear false witness.” Therefore, as a Christian, you better answer the door and tell our drunk neighbor with the shotgun, that his wife, whom he is looking to kill, is hiding in our basement. Otherwise, you are defying God himself!

                                 To assume any law, even divine, applies to every person, in every time, in every situation, even though not explicitly stated, is an assumption not grounded in evidence, and fallacious reasoning.

                                Stating the general rule when a good argument can be made that the action in question is a violation of the rule, would not be considered fallacious.

                                 I included three examples that demonstrate this fallacy from the very obvious to the less obvious, but equally as flawed.  In the first example, it is obvious because weight is cumulative.  In the second example, we know that water is wet, but we only experience the property of wetness when the molecules are combined and in large scale.  This introduces the concept of

                                .  The final example is a common argument made for a supernatural explanation for consciousness.  On the surface, it is difficult to imagine a collection of molecules resulting in something like consciousness because we are focusing on the properties of the parts (molecules) and not the whole system, which incorporates emergence, motion, the use of energy, temperature (vibration), order, and other

                                 If the whole is very close to the similarity of the parts, then more assumptions can be made from the parts to the whole.  For example, if we open a small bag of potato chips and discover that the first one is delicious, it is not fallacious to conclude that the whole snack (all the chips, minus the bag) will be just as delicious, but we cannot say the same for one of those giant family size bags because most of us would be hurling after about 10 minutes of our chip-eating frenzy.

      I heard that the Catholic Church was involved in a sex scandal cover-up.  Therefore, my 102-year-old Catholic neighbor, who frequently attends Church, is guilty as well!

                                 While it is possible that the 102-year-old granny is guilty for some things, like being way too liberal with her perfume, she would not be guilty in any sex scandals just by her association with the Church alone. Granted, it can be argued that Granny’s financial support of the Church makes her morally complicit, but it is clear her “crimes” are in a different category than those behind the cover-ups.

                                 The fact that men score better on math than women is a group generalization. This does not mean that any individual man will score better than any individual woman on math. Educated guesses could be made if we knew more about the statistics. For example, if we just knew that men scored an average of 8% higher than women, we could not even say that any given man is likely to be better at math than any given woman. This is because there could be what is referred to as an uneven distribution, that is, there could be a small group of women who are really bad at math or a small group of men who are really good at math that throws off the curve.

                                      A study was done recently showing that church attendance was positively correlated with marriage longevity, that is, those couples who attended church together more often were more likely to stay married. This really should not be a surprise considering the general view of divorce within religion. 
                                <strong>What this does not mean is that any given couple who does not attend church is more likely to get divorced than any given couple that does attend church.</strong>
                                    
                            </p>

                                <strong>Explanation:</strong>
                                 To make this claim, we would need more information on the raw data used. Perhaps just religious fanatics who go to church daily have a practically non-existent divorce rate of say 2%. Then it is possible that those who never go to church have a lower divorce rate than those who do go to church every Sunday, but because of the fanatics, the distribution is not evenly distributed.

                                 It is not unreasonable to make a probabilistic claim about any given member of a group if the data warrants such a claim. For example, if 999 jellybeans in a jar are red and one is green, we can say that any given jellybean in the jar is  99.9% likely to be red.

                                 Although this is a statistical fallacy, it is commonly extended to everyday situations. If you don't mind getting into statistics a bit, understanding statistical fallacies could improve one's overall reasoning ability.

      The Bible is the Word of God because God tells us it is... in the Bible.

                                <strong>Explanation:</strong>
                                 This is a very serious circular argument on which many people base their entire lives. The circularity is in the stated or implied claim that the reason they trust in the Bible is because it is the Word of God.  This is like getting an e-mail from a Nigerian prince, offering to give you his billion dollar fortune -- but only after you wire him a “good will” offering of $50,000.  Of course, you are skeptical until you read the final line in the e-mail that reads 
                                <i>“I, prince Nubadola, assure you that this is my message, and it is legitimate.  You can trust this e-mail and any others that come from me.”  </i>
                                Now you know it is legitimate... because it says so in the e-mail.
    
                            </p>

                                <strong>Exception:</strong>
                                 Some philosophies state that we can never escape circular reasoning because the arguments always come back to axioms or first principles, but in those cases, the circles are very large and do manage to share useful information in determining the truth of the proposition.

                                <strong>Tip:</strong>
                                 Do your best to avoid circular arguments, as it will help you reason better because better reasoning is often a result of avoiding circular arguments.

                                 This is a contradiction.  At first glance, “as long as” appears to be a condition for the assertion, “I don’t care what you believe”, but it’s not; the assertion 
                                <i>has to be</i>
                                 false in all cases.  
                                <i>The arguer must always care if the person believes something that will harm others or not.</i>

                                <strong>Exception:</strong>
                                 When the self-contradictory statement is not put forth as an argument, but rather as an ironic statement, perhaps with the intent to convey some kind of deeper truth or meaning, but not necessarily to be taken literally, then this fallacy is not committed.

                                      In an example used by Sigmund Freud in 
                                <i>The Interpretation of Dreams</i>
                                , a man accused by his neighbor of having returned a kettle in a damaged condition offered three arguments:
    
                            </p>
                            <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
                                      That he had returned the kettle undamaged;

                                That he had never borrowed it in the first place.

                                 Each statement contradicts the one before. If it was already damaged, how did he return it undamaged? If he never borrowed it, how was it already damaged when he borrowed it?

      I don't believe in God. One reason is that I think he is evil. And by the way, there is no such thing as "evil;" it is just our evaluation of what we believe is wrong.

                                 There are multiple statements here that all contradict, stemmed from the idea that the person does not believe in God. If he or she does not believe in God, how can he or she think God is evil? And if there is no such thing as evil, how can something be evil?

                                 If one acknowledges that their previous argument has been defeated (explicitly or implicitly), and they make a new argument, this would be more like moving the goalposts.

                                <strong>Tip:</strong>
                                 If you are trying to be funny, kettle logic can be a great tool. In the movie “Philomena,” Steve Coogan’s character, Martin Sixsmith, leaves a church ceremony early. When asked why he says, “I don’t believe in God, and I think he knows.”

                                This fallacy can be tricky because maybe it is true that aliens are responsible for spreading life, so the answers might be technically right, but the question implied is how life

                                 Remember that fallacious techniques don’t require the person using them to be lacking in reason; it is the audience or interlocutor that is at risk for falling for the deception.

                                 Instead of just “not believing” in God, we are  “rejecting” God, which is a much stronger term—especially when God is associated with “goodness.”

                                 Instead of using the more accepted term “miracles,” the word “magic” is used that connotes powers associated with fantasy and make-believe in an attempt to make the stories in the Bible seem foolish.

                                 Angels are said to be ghost-like in that they don’t take up space. “Fit” is a word that refers to space. The question is meaningless.

                                 As you read through the examples, you can see from where the word “hypnotic” comes.  Your subconscious mind starts to take over, and it seems almost reactionary that you start chanting “yes” or “no” (as in the second example) while not really considering with what you are agreeing or disagreeing.  These kinds of techniques work best in rallies where those doing the rallying count on you to act with emotion at the expense of your reason.

                                 The term “faith” used by the priest, was in the religious sense of believing in God without sufficient evidence, which is different from having “faith” in your son in which years of good past performance leads to the “faith” you might have in your son.

      President Petutti ordered a military strike that killed many civilians. He is no different than any other mass murder and he belongs in prison!

                                <strong>Explanation:</strong>
                                 Both president Petutti and a mass murder share the characteristic that something they did resulted in the death of civilians. However, the circumstances, the level of responsibility, and the intent are significantly different for the president than the typical mass murder and ignoring these factors is unreasonable, thus makes the argument fallacious.

                                <strong>Explanation: </strong>
                                In this case, the first "thing" is the weapon as understood at the time the second amendment was passed. The second "thing" of comparison is the nuclear submarine, also a weapon, but one of significantly different magnitude. This example also introduces the difference between a legal justification and an argumentative one (see

                                 In 2011, Christian broadcaster, Harold Camping, (once again) predicted the end of the world via Jesus, and managed to get many Christians to join his alarmist campaign.  During this time, and especially after the Armageddon date had passed,  many Christian groups publicly declared that Camping is not a “true Christian”.  On a personal note, I think Camping was and is as much of a Christian as any other self-proclaimed Christian and religious/political/ethical beliefs aside, I give him credit for having the cojones to make a falsifiable claim about his religious beliefs.

                                 This is a very common form of this fallacy that has many variations.  Every time one group member denounces another group member for doing or saying something that they don’t approve of, usually by the phrase, “he is not really a 
                                <i>true</i>
                                 [insert membership here]”, this fallacy is committed.

                                      The universal claim here is that no UbaTuba White Men's Club member will ever (universal) go to jail.  Marvin points out how clearly this is counterfactual as there are many UbaTuba White Men's Club members in jail.  Instead of conceding or meaningfully revising the claim, the implication that no "UbaTuba White Men's Club members" is changed to “no true UbaTuba White Men's Club members”, which is not meaningful because John’s definition of a “true UbaTuba White Men's Club member” apparently can only be demonstrated in the negative if an UbaTuba White Men's Club member goes to jail.  This results in the

                                 can be seen when the claim is that someone "does not have enough of" something, which is why they are not meeting the condition. For example, "If you have the desire for success, you will succeed!" Billy has the desire but is not succeeding. Therefore, Billy's desire is not strong (or pure) enough. The difference between the

                                 and the

                                      Another variation is what I call the 
                                <em>no true crossover fallacy</em>
                                . This fallacy is committed when one denies, for the purpose of protecting one of the groups, that an individual can be a part of two or more non-exclusionary groups. During the protests in the spring of 2020, many businesses have been vandalized, looted, and even burned down. When people blamed this on the protesters, the defense was that “protesters protest and looters loot.” The implication is that the moment a protester loots, they become a “looter,” and no longer are part of the group “protesters.” This is a way of absolving every “true” member of the group “protesters” from any wrongdoing. It is likely that there are a group of looters who are opportunists and have no ideological position and would not qualify in any reasonable way as “protesters.” It is clear, however, that there are protesters who believe looting is an effective tool for protesting. Similarly, attempting to absolve police officers from wrongdoing because “police officers police and criminals commit crimes” is equally as fallacious for all the same reasons.

                                 People will sometimes claim outright that if any person who claims to be a member of group X and has Y characteristic, is not a member of group X. Ask them if those who claim to be a member of group X and has Y characteristic would agree.

                                <strong>Example #2: </strong>
                                In the hilarious Broadway musical, 
                                <i>The Book of Mormon</i>
                                , there is a musical number where one character is explaining how to bury "bad thoughts" by just "turning them off" (like a light switch). The character doing the explaining (in glorious song) is specifically explaining to the main character how to suppress gay thoughts when the main character's "bad thoughts" have nothing to do with being gay. After the instructions, the main character tries to make this clear by affirming, "
                                <i>
                                    <strong>I'm</strong>

                                 not having gay thoughts," to which the other characters respond "Hurray! It worked!"
    
                            </p>

                                <strong>Explanation:</strong>
                                 The stress on the "I'm" was ignored and confused for "Hey, I'm 
                                <i>not</i>
                                 having gay thoughts anymore!" Although this was comedy it portrayed an argument.

                                 Our biases can cause us to miss the vocal nuance. Listen actively and critically, and try not to jump to conclusions. And you cannot turn off gay thoughts like a light switch.

                                 This example is actually the origin of the fallacy, which refers to a 1952 speech by Noah S. “Soggy” Sweat, Jr., a young lawmaker from the U.S. state of Mississippi, on the subject of whether Mississippi should continue to prohibit (which it did until 1966) or finally legalize alcoholic beverages.  I think it is hilarious, so I am including it here in its entirety.

      My friends, I had not intended to discuss this controversial subject at this particular time. However, I want you to know that I do not shun controversy. On the contrary, I will take a stand on any issue at any time, regardless of how fraught with controversy it might be. You have asked me how I feel about whiskey. All right, here is how I feel about whiskey:
    </p>
                            <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      If when you say whiskey you mean the devil’s brew, the poison scourge, the bloody monster, that defiles innocence, dethrones reason, destroys the home, creates misery and poverty, yea, literally takes the bread from the mouths of little children; if you mean the evil drink that topples the Christian man and woman from the pinnacle of righteous, gracious living into the bottomless pit of degradation, and despair, and shame and helplessness, and hopelessness, then certainly I am against it.
    </p>
                            <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      But, if when you say whiskey you mean the oil of conversation, the philosophic wine, the ale that is consumed when good fellows get together, that puts a song in their hearts and laughter on their lips, and the warm glow of contentment in their eyes; if you mean Christmas cheer; if you mean the stimulating drink that puts the spring in the old gentleman’s step on a frosty, crispy morning; if you mean the drink which enables a man to magnify his joy, and his happiness, and to forget, if only for a little while, life’s great tragedies, and heartaches, and sorrows; if you mean that drink, the sale of which pours into our treasuries untold millions of dollars, which are used to provide tender care for our little crippled children, our blind, our deaf, our dumb, our pitiful aged and infirm; to build highways and hospitals and schools, then certainly I am for it.

                                <strong>Explanation:</strong>
                                 This is an amazing insight into the human mind and the area of rhetoric.  We can see how when both sides of the issue are presented through the same use of emotionally charged words and phrases, the argument is really vacuous and presents very little factual information, nor does it even take a stance on the issue.
    
                            </p>

                                <strong>Example #2: </strong>
                                Having evaluated literally thousands of positions on God by people all over the belief spectrum, I thought I would create my own, “If-by-God” version of the argument, showing how carefully placed rhetoric can blur the line between the most perfect being imaginable and the most horrible being imaginable.
    
                            </p>
                            <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      The question is, if God does exist, should we love him and worship him?  My position is clear, and I am not embarrassed to let the world know exactly how I feel.  So here it goes.
    </p>
                            <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      If by God you mean the great dictator in the sky, the almighty smiter, the God who created us with imperfections then holds us responsible for the imperfections, the God who took away paradise and eternal life from us because the first man and woman committed a “wrong” against God before they were capable of knowing right from wrong, the God who commanded his chosen people to utterly destroy every man, woman, and child in dozens of cities, the God who hardened hearts, killed first-borns, demanded blood sacrifices, commanded man to brutally kill other humans for “crimes” such as “not honoring your parents”, the God who destroyed virtually all living creatures on the planet, the God who would demand that his own son be brutally murdered to pay a debt to him, the God who allows children to be born with birth defects, die young, and get cancer, the God who continues to destroy using floods, hurricanes, and other natural disasters, the God who ignores the prayers of billions of his faithful followers, the God who allows a majority of his creation to suffer through unimaginable torture for all eternity in the fiery pits of Hell, then he is certainly not deserving of our love and worship.

                            <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      But, if when you say God you mean the defender, the protector, creator of heaven and earth, the father of us all, the being of pure love, kindness, and everything good in the world, the God who led the Israelites from slavery to freedom, the one who looks after us all, the God who heals the sick in his son’s name, the God who gave us his perfect laws for our benefit, the God who loved us so much, that he sacrificed his only son so that we can be saved, the God who allows us to spend a blissful eternity with him and our loved ones, then certainly he is deserving of our love and worship.

      Assuming one accepts the premise that "everyone should do something nice for someone," the word "someone" in that sentence means "some person or another" whereas in the second sentence it means "a specific person." By equivocating the meanings of "someone," we appear to be making a strong argument when in fact we are not.

                                 This is such a common fallacy, yet rarely detected as one.  Usually, out of fear of embarrassment, we accept confusing definitions as legitimate elucidations, that is, we pretend the term that was defined is now clear to us.  What exactly is the field?  How is it detected? Are there negative and positive ones? How do we know?

                                <strong>Explanation:</strong>
                                 Many times, we fool ourselves into thinking that because we know other words for the term, we better understand what the term 
                                <i>actually represents</i>
                                .  The above example is an illustration of this.  We can redefine, “spirit” as many times as we like, but our understanding of what a spirit actually is will still be lacking.
    
                            </p>
                            <p class="Body">
      Assuming we did not really understand what was meant by “spirit”, the definition, “noncorporeal substance” might or might not shed any light on what is meant by the term.  In this case, it might be more clear now that Linda is not referring to alcoholic beverages, but conceptually, what is a non-physical substance?  If “substance” is defined as being physical matter or material, does a “non-physical” substance even make sense?
    </p>
                            <p class="Body">
      We fallaciously reason that we now understand what the term represents when, in fact, we don’t.

                                 Some may actually just lack the vocabulary needed -- this is not your fault, but you should do your best to attempt to elucidate using words understandable to your audience.

                                <strong>Tip:</strong>
                                 Failure to elucidate often results in endless and pointless debates. Take, for example, the common position that guns are not a problem in the USA. We often see this position presented as an unhelpful meme, such as "Guns don't kill people, people kill people." What this needs is a "therefore," followed by a conclusion. For example, "Guns don't kill people, people kill people. Therefore, we should be focusing more on what makes people use guns violently and less on just banning the use of guns." This is very different from, "Guns don't kill people, people kill people. Therefore, anyone should be allowed to carry any kind of gun with no restrictions." Don't waste your time imagining the argument or point the other person is trying to make—ask for clarification.

                                 It should be clear by the two examples who is defending what position.  Both arguers are taking the opportunity to define a term as a way to take a cheap shot at the opponent.  In some cases, they might actually hope their definition is accepted, which would make it very easy to defend, compared to the actual definition.

      We are guilty of extensional pruning if we use words in their commonly accepted meaning, but retreat when challenged into a strictly literal definition. The fallacy becomes possible because there are two ways of understanding what words mean. We can describe the properties of what we refer to, or we can give examples. The first is called the ‘intension’, and the second is the ‘extension’ of the word. We could convey the sense of an expression such as ‘movie star’, for example, either by describing the role of lead actors and actresses in films, or by listing several well-known stars.
    </p>
                            <p>
      Words carry nuances of meaning by their associations. Little tendrils of thought ripple around them, evoking all kinds of ideas dependent on past associations. These nuances are part of the meaning of the word, provided they are understood by user and hearer alike. The fallacy of extensional pruning takes place when the user subsequently retreats from that meaning by insisting upon only a literal ‘intentional’ definition.

      The fallacy is committed by saying one thing, but permitting another to be understood. A contention must be the same to

      both user and hearer, or no reasoned discussion is possible. There are two ways of committing this fallacy: one is to mislead at the outset, the other is to retreat to a restricted definition in order to escape weaknesses in the position.

      The extensional pruner announces his activity. Like the bow wave of an advancing ship, his utterances mark his passage. The inevitable ‘all I said was…’ and ‘if you examine my exact words…’ show him to be a man of great qualifications. You recognize him as the man who never really said at all what most people took him to be saying. The fine print one always watches for is in this case in the dictionary.
    </p>
                            <p>
      You can add extensional pruning to your repertoire once you are adept at making a limited statement pass itself off as a wider one. Gather yourself a collection of phrases whose meaning is understood by everyone, even though the words themselves are more restricted.

                                <strong>Explanation:</strong>
                                 This argument is guilty of two cases of ambiguity.  First, the first use of the phrase, “come from”, refers to 
                                <i>reproduction</i>
                                , whereas the second use refers to 
                                <i>origin</i>
                                .  The fact that we know quite a bit about reproduction is irrelevant when considering origin.  Second, the first use of, “living being”, refers to an empirically verifiable, biological, living organism.  The second use of, “living being”, refers to a belief in an immaterial god.  As you can see, when a term such as, “living being”, describes a Dodo bird as well as the all-powerful master of the universe, it has very little meaning and certainly is not specific enough to draw logical or reasonable conclusions.

                                 “Black Lives Matter” is a political ideology that has evolved from a simple declaration. Like all ideologies, it has many branches ranging from moderate to extreme. Bernice clearly has a different concept of Black Lives Matter than Mildred does. An argument can be had over who is perverting the ideology (we have seen this among different Christians for millennia), but the point remains that what is meant by “supporting Black Lives Matter” has become unclear.

                                      The difference between first and second in many cases is negligible, statistically, yet we give those differences artificial meaning.  Who was the

                                  We often artificially assign significant meaning to tiny statistical differences.  It is a fallacy when we infer that the first place runner is “much faster” than the second place runner, even though the difference is .01 seconds.

                                 In reality, tiny statistical differences can have a significant impact, regardless of our interpretation.  For example, jumping out of the way of a car .01 seconds too late can mean the difference between a close call, and death.

      Rob: The terms “right” and “wrong” are based on cultural norms, which do have a subjective foundation -- one that changes as the moral sphere of the culture changes.  The term “heavy” does not have an objective standard, yet we have no problem using that term in a meaningful way.  In fact, very few relational terms have any kind of objective foundation.

                                 Perhaps the most classic example of this fallacy is the argument for the existence of God.  Due to the understanding of nature through science, many of the arguments that used to be used for God (or gods) were abandoned, only to be replaced with new ones, usually involving questions to which science has not definitively answered yet.  The move from creationism to

                                 The salesperson was referring to the different types of cars (models) Toyota makes, not how many instances (or tokens) of each car were manufactured. By not specifically stating "types of cars" or "models," the statement was ambiguous and unnecessarily confusing.

                                 Greg means that he had the same type of suit as George Clooney. Tim was probably being a smart-ass with his response, but in case he wasn’t, he confused the type with the token (that unique suit).

                                Here, “Mother Nature” is being portrayed as an autonomous being capable of going to war with humanity. If this were the case, it would seem that messing with Mother Nature is futile. In reality, we are part of nature and can and always have changed nature, sometimes for the worse, but often for the better.

                                Love is an abstraction, not a little fat flying baby with a bow and arrow that searches for victims.  Cute sayings such as this one can serve as bad advice for people who would otherwise make an effort to find a romantic partner, but choose not to, believing that this "love entity" is busy searching for his or her ideal mate.

                                 In most cases, even in the above examples, these are used as rhetorical devices. When the reification is deliberate and harmless, and not used as evidence to support a claim or conclusion, then it is not fallacious.

                                 Murder applies to humans, not carrots. By definition, one cannot murder carrots. In this example, the carrots are assumed to have the human characteristics that make murder “murder” and not just “killing” or “eating.”

                                 The goddess, Pele, and her daughter are given the human quality of the frailty of life in order for the concept of “sacrifice” to be meaningful.

                                 If you want to make people laugh, give objects and small animals human qualities. Anthropomorphism is a comedy goldmine for stand-up comedians.

                                     In the summer of 2020 when racial tensions were high, many media sources did their part to solve racism by capitalizing the “B” when referring to black people while keeping the “w” lowercase when referring to white people. Some sources that picked up this story saw this as a token gesture to help shield them from public claims of racism.

                                Many podcast hosts, journalists, and other public figures who discuss issues of race have got themselves in serious trouble by reporting on people who use the “N-word,” by actually using the word themselves (I won’t use it here because I don’t want to be one of those casualties). This is because a small, but vocal, group view the mention of the word as nefarious as the use of the word, when the two are substantially different.

                                 Suzie meant to “define some words” but Tyrone defined the word “some.” Tyrone thinks he won the exchange but he did not really define any sophisticated words.

                                 When only two choices are presented yet more exist, or a spectrum of possible choices exists between two extremes.  False dilemmas are usually characterized by “either this or that” language, but can also be characterized by omissions of choices.  Another variety is the false trilemma, which is when three choices are presented when more exist.

      I thought you were a good person, but you weren’t at church today.

                                The assumption here is that if one doesn't attend chuch, one

                                 be bad.  Of course, good people exist who don’t go to church, and good church-going people could have had a really good reason not to be in church -- like a hangover from the swingers' gathering the night before.
    
                            </p>
                            <p class="Body">
                                      
                                <strong>Exception:</strong>
                                 There may be cases when the number of options really is limited.  For example, if an ice cream man just has chocolate and vanilla left, it would be a waste of time insisting he has mint chocolate chip. 
    
                            </p>
                            <p class="Body">
      It is also not a fallacy if other options exist, but you are not offering other options as a possibility.  For example:

                                 Staying true to the definitions, the 
                                <i>false dilemma</i>
                                  is different from the 
                                <i>false dichotomy</i>
                                 in that a dilemma implies two equally unattractive options whereas a dichotomy generally comprises two opposites. This is a fine point, however, and is generally ignored in common usage.

      When the arguments for and against courses of action are asses-sed, it is important to remember that the choice has to be made from the available alternatives. All of them might be criticized for their imperfections, as might the status quo. Unless one of the options is perfect, the imperfections of the others are insufficient grounds for rejection. The fallacy of unobtainable perfection is committed when lack of perfection is urged as a basis for reject-ion, even though none of the alternatives is perfect either.

      We should ban the generation of nuclear power because it can never be made completely safe.

                            <p>
      (Also coal, oil and hydro-electric, all of which kill people every year in production and use. The question should be whether nuclear power would be better or worse than they are.)

    </p>
                            <p>
      If none of the alternatives, including making no change at all, is perfect, then imperfection is not grounds for a decision between them. To the matter of that choice it is irrelevant. If used to criticize only one option, it unfairly loads the case against that choice because it could be applied to all of them.

      Television documentaries and public affairs programmes are excellent source material for the unobtainable perfection fallacy. Any new proposal of government, any government, will be subjected to detailed analysis of its imperfections. Frail widows and struggling mothers will relate to cameras the hardships which will be caused, and the audience will be left with the uneasy feeling that the government is being too hasty. Exactly the same treatment could be given to the present situation.

      The fallacy haunts the polished halls of committee meetings. On every committee is one person, usually a long-serving member, whose mission in life is to hold back the tide of anarchy and destruction which change represents. He castigates every new proposal with its own imperfections.

      I don't think banning cars from Park Street will prevent old people being hurt. There will still be children on roller-blades and bicycles, and shopping trolleys and baby carriages.

                            <p>

      While you can use the general version of this fallacy to undermine any proposals you disapprove of, it will also repay you if you take the time and trouble to learn two specialist and very clever versions of it. The first of these calls for a particular suggestion to be opposed because it does not go far enough. You show its imperfections, and suggest that something more drastic is needed. This idea, therefore, should be rejected.

      I approve in principle of the proposal to have the benefits allocated by lot, rather than by my personal decision, but this will still leave many areas of patronage and influence untouched. I suggest that a much wider measure is needed, looking at the whole field, and therefore I propose that we refer this suggestion back…

                            <p>
      The second variant you can use has you calling for something totally beyond the powers of those making the decision, and thus sets something they cannot do in opposition to something they can.

                                Establishing causality is extremely tricky. Unless you are stating an established fact, start using more probabilistic language such as "contributes to," "leads to," "has been known to reduce the effects of," or similar language.

                                      In a valid categorical syllogism, if the two premises are universal, then the conclusion

                                 be universal, as well.

      The reasoning behind this fallacy becomes clear when you use classes without any members, and the conclusion states that there are members of this class -- which is wrong.

                                <strong>Explanation:</strong>
                                 In both examples, the fallacy is committed because we have two universal premises and a particular conclusion, but our example #1 conclusion makes sense, no?  
                                <strong>
                                    Just because the conclusion 
                                    <i>might</i>
                                      be true, does not mean the logic used to produce it, was valid.  
                                </strong>
                                This is how tests like SAT’s and GRE’s screw us over and, technically, in the above example, 
                                <i>all</i>
                                 babysitter club members have pimples, not just
                                <i>  some</i>
                                .
    
                            </p>
                            <p class="Body">
      Now, look at the second example.  Same form, but when we use classes that obviously (to most people) have no members (leprechauns), we can see that it results in a conclusion that is false. 
    </p>
                            <p class="Body">
                                      
                                <strong>Exception:</strong>

                                <i>is</i>
                                 an exception to this formal fallacy -- if we are strictly using Aristotelian logic, then it is permissible because apparently, Aristotle did not see a problem with presupposing that classes have members even when we are not explicitly told that they do.

      In a half-concealed qualification, the words themselves express a limited claim, but the stress and construction is such that the qualifications are glossed over. Although the limits are stated, the audience barely notice them on the way to a discussion about a more general statement.
    </p>

                                <em>Practically every single case of monetary expansion is followed within months by an attendant general price rise of the same proportions.</em>
                                    
                            </p>
                            <p data-amp-original-style="padding-left: 40px;" class="amp-wp-fe4704d">
      (This is the classic statement of sado-monetarism. Note the first word – nobody else does.)

    </p>
                            <p>
                                      In this example, the qualifying word ‘practically’ is half-concealed by the stress given to 
                                <em>‘every single case’.</em>
                                 Should embarrassing cases turn up which do not follow the rule, one can always retreat to the qualification and point out that the assertion did not claim to cover 
                                <em>all</em>
                                  instances.
    
                            </p>
                            <p>
      There is a fallacy inherent in making a restricted claim and then engaging in discussion as if it were a general claim. The important information that the assertion does not apply to all cases is omitted from consideration. The fact that the limitation is expressed does not remove the fallacy. It is the fact that the qualification is half-concealed which causes it to be unnoticed, and which excludes relevant information.

                                      Half-concealed qualification is widely used to support half a case. When there is a gap in the evidence supporting a complete link, the fallacy papers over the crack. Science and philosophy do not admit unexplained exceptions. Newton would not have got very far by telling us that objects are 
                                <em>usually</em>
                                 attracted towards each other by a force which varies inversely with the square of the distance between them. In daily life, however, we are less rigorous, and the fallacy finds room to make a partial case seem like a complete one.

      There is a common character trait which will help you to get away with half-concealed qualifications. It expresses itself in a readiness to think of cases which do fit, rather than of cases which do not. On being given a limited statement, such as ‘Most bosses flirt with their secretaries’, many people will find themselves thinking of cases which they have known. Few find their thoughts led immediately to bosses who do not do this. You can use this propensity to have more read into your assertions than they are really claiming.

      When statements are made about a class, sometimes they are about all of the members of it, sometimes about some of them, and at other times it is not clear which is referred to. The fallacy of concealed quantification occurs when ambiguity of expression permits a misunderstanding of the quantity which is spoken of.

      (What, all of them? It does not say, but there is a big difference. If it refers to all of them, then to talk to one is to talk to a crook. Although many motorists may have their convictions, few of the garage mechanics do.)

      Very often the quantification is concealed because it sounds rather lame to make bold statements about some of a class. ‘All’ is much better, but probably untrue. Rather than be limited by such a technicality, a speaker will often leave out the quantity in the hope that ‘all’ will be understood. Someone might commiserate with a distraught parent by telling them: ‘Teenagers are troublesome.’ This can be accepted as ‘some are,’ or even ‘many tend to be so’, but it could also be taken to mean that one has only to find a teenager to locate a troublesome person. This may not have been intended, however plausible it sounds. The fallacy comes with the ambiguity. The statement can be accepted with one meaning, yet intended with another. Of course, very different conclusions can be drawn from the two meanings.

      You should use concealed quantification to make a weak case look stronger than it is. If you are trying to sow doubts about a person, you can use their membership of some group to cast general aspersions about them. Make reasonable-sounding statements which are true of some, and allow your audience to supply the ‘all’ or the ‘only’ which are needed to brand him as well.

                                 If you are not sure if a syllogism is fallacious or not, keep substituting the items in the syllogism for other items. If a syllogism is consistent with the form but clearly doesn’t make sense, you will know that it is fallacious.

                                <strong>Explanation:</strong>
                                 We are told that Debbie and TJ have two sons and two daughters, so logically, by necessity, they must 
                                <i>have at</i>
                                 least one son.  However, to say that Debbie and TJ 
                                <i>must</i>
                                 have at least one son, is to 
                                <i>confuse the scope of the modal</i>
                                , or in this case, to take the 
                                <i>contingent fact</i>
                                 that applies to the specific case that is conditional upon Debbie and TJ having the two sons and two daughters, to the general hypothetical case where they don’t have to have any children.  Therefore, if they don’t 
                                <i>have to</i>

                                This is one of those fallacies that would make you look foolish for calling someone out on, unless you are among all academic philosophers. In casual argumentation many people do mean "possibility" and not "necessity." Remember to offer others a charitable interpretation of their argument.

                                 By definition, no Catholics are Jews (using type “E” form here) -- clear enough.  Now let’s take the contraposition of that proposition by switching the placement of “Catholics” and “Jews”, and negating each, and we can see we have a false proposition.  “No non-Jews are non-Catholics” clearly does not mean the same thing as “No Catholics are Jews”.  In this example, the premise is true but the conclusion is false (I am a non-Jew and a non-Catholic, and statistically speaking, you probably are too.)

                                 We now see the type “I” form in action, stating, “Some” dogs bark.  This is true, but that really does not matter in determining what form of an argument is valid or not.  The conclusion, “some non-barking things are non-dogs” is also a true statement (my toothbrush, which is a non-dog, does not bark), but this does not matter either.  What does matter, is that it does not logically follow.  Don’t be misled by truth!  Focus on the form of the argument.  If we substitute other terms we can see the fallacy more clearly:

                                      By using the word, “some”, we are not asserting that there are definitely some

                                .  Above, just by saying that some humans are mortal, we automatically are saying that there are others who are not mortal.  Therefore, our conclusion is supposing a group that does not exist, thus fallacious.

      Using the type “A” form, let’s say that all humans are mortals.  The contraposition: all immortals are non-human.  Not only does this make sense in terms of truth, but it follows necessarily from the premise; therefore, it is valid (and not a fallacy).

      Science often gets things wrong.  It wasn’t until the early 20th century when particle physics came along that scientists realized that the atom wasn’t the smallest particle in existence.  So perhaps science will soon realize that it is wrong about the age of the universe, the non-existence of a global flood, evolution, and every other science fact that contradicts the Bible when read literally.

                                 To see this fallacy, let’s put it in the logical form, using just the evolution claim:
    
                            </p>
                            <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      P1. Thinking the atom was the smallest particle was a mistake of science.

                            <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      P2. Evolution is also a mistake of science.
    </p>
                            <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
      C. Therefore, science thinking the atom was the smallest particle is like science thinking evolution is true.
    </p>
                            <p class="Body">
                                      Premise two (P2) should jump out as a bold assumption, although not fallacious.  Remember, the premises don’t have to be true for the argument to be valid, but if both premises were true, does the conclusion (C) follow?  No, because of the 
                                <i>extended fallacy</i>
                                .  The reason is if evolution were false it would not be for the same reason that science thought the atom was the smallest particle.  Science “was wrong” in that case because it did not have access to the whole truth due to discoveries yet to be made at the time.  If evolution were wrong, then all the discoveries that have been made, the facts that have been established, the foundation of many sciences that have led to countless advances in medicine, would all be dead wrong.  This would be a mistake of unimaginable proportions and consequences that would unravel the very core of scientific understanding and inquiry.

                                     The conclusion might be true -- I had a pet rock growing up, but the argument still does not logically support that.  Think of sets and subsets.  All cats are animals: we have a set of animals and a subset of cats.  “Some” pets are cats: so all we know is that there is a part of our set, “pets” that intersects with the subset, “cats”, but we don’t have the information we need to conclude logically that some pets are not animals.  This argument is invalid, thus as a formal argument, it is fallacious.

        No matter how good the logic may be, you cannot rely on an argument which has certain falsity built into it. For a sound argument true premises are needed, as well as valid logic. The problem with contradictory premises is that they cannot both be true. If one is true, the other must be false, and vice versa. In other words, we can be certain that at least one of them must be false, and cannot therefore generate a sound argument.

        (This might look like an argument against pantheism, but it is in fact an argument against common sense. Since the premises contradict each other, one must be false. This makes any conclusion unreliable.)

        The fallacy is an interesting one because it permits the logic to be valid. It usually amazes non-logicians to hear that with inconsistent premises any conclusion, no matter how irrelevant, can be validly inferred. Logicians, however, do not use the word ‘valid’ to mean ‘sound’, If there is known falsity built in, as there must be with contradictory premises, then it matters not how good the logic is: the argument is not sound.

        There is nothing wrong with the logic. The known falsity in the contradictory premises can be used to establish anything, including a rather smelly satellite.

                                <p>
        It is difficult to use the fallacy of contradictory premises in everyday argument, because your audience will normally see that you are contradicting yourself. What you can do, however, is to use contradictions which are normally accepted in loose speech, and proceed to wrap them up in tight logic.

                                 Actually, that is not the case.  “Someone’s pet dog”, assuming a real dog and not some robot dog, would also be a member of the canine species.  Therefore, the canine species includes wolves,  coyotes, as well as your neighbor’s Shih Tzu, who is likely to bite you just because he’s pissed for being so small.

                                 Karen is a thirty-something-year-old female who drives a mini-van, lives in the suburbs, and wears mom jeans. Is Karen more likely to be a woman or a mom?
    
                            </p>
                            <p class="Body">
                                      
                                <strong>Explanation:</strong>
                                 It would be fallacious to say that Karen is more likely to be a mom—even if we found out that Karen spent an hour each day at the playground with other moms. There is a 100% chance the Karen is a woman (we know she is female), and a smaller chance that she is a mom.
    
                            </p>
                            <p class="Body">

                            <p class="Body">
      In the example above, the way the question reads, we now know that there is a 100% chance Karen is a woman and a smaller chance that she is a mom. However, if the questioner meant to imply, “not a mom” or “mom” as the choices, then it could be more of a poorly phrased question than a fallacy.

      Mr. Pius goes to church every Sunday.  He gets most of his information about religion from church and does not really read the Bible too much.  Mr. Pius has a figurine of St. Mary at home.  Last year, when he went to Rome, he toured the Vatican.  From this information, Mr. Pius is more likely to be Catholic than a Catholic or a Muslim.

                                 This is incorrect.  While it is very likely that Mr. Pius is Catholic based on the information, it is more likely that he is Catholic or Muslim.

      If you are thinking, “But it can be both Monday and Sunday if we are talking about two different time zones,” then give your self three points for being clever, then subtract four points for missing the whole point of the fallacy.

                                 No!  I did not have to follow the, “if it’s yellow, let it mellow” rule -- in fact, if I did follow that rule I would probably still be single.  The stated rule is simply, “if it’s brown” (the 
                                <i>antecedent</i>
                                ), then (implied), “flush it down” (the 
                                <i>consequent</i>
                                ).  From this, we cannot imply that we can ONLY flush it down if it is brown.  That is a mistake -- a logical fallacy.

                                 Remember why fallacies are so dangerous: because they appear to be good reasoning.  The conclusion in example #1 makes sense, but it does not follow logically -- it is an invalid argument.  Based on the first two premises, there is no way logically to deduce that conclusion.  Now, look at examples #2 and #3.  We use the same logical form of the argument, committing the same fallacy, but by changing the terms it is much more clear that something went wrong somewhere, and it did.  This kind of argument, the 
                                <i>categorical syllogism</i>
                                , cannot have two negative premises and still be valid.

      Just because the conclusion appears true, it does not mean the argument is valid (or strong, in the case of an informal argument).

                                 The examples used are just two different logical forms of the same fallacy.  Because the reporter, “thinks” the statement is made in an intensional context, we cannot switch the terms.  However, if we were to keep the premises in an extensional context, we could get away with switching the terms.  This would be a valid logical argument form known as

                                  that this is the case because the use of “some” does not logically imply that it does not mean “all”.  In everyday use, “some” does

                                  “not all”, that is why this is fallacious and could be used to deceive without technically lying.

                                 Statistically speaking, the son may still have a low chance of acceptance. The school is for brilliant kids (and everyone knows this), so the vast majority of kids who apply are brilliant. Of the whole population of brilliant kids who apply, only about 6% get accepted. So even if the son is brilliant, he still has a low chance of being accepted (about 6%).

                                 Faith healing "works," but not all the time, especially when one’s faith is not strong enough (as generally indicated by the size of one’s financial offering).  Unbiased, empirical tests, demonstrate that a small but noticeable percentage of people are cured of “incurable” diseases such as cancer.
    
                            </p>
                            <p class="Body">
                                      
                                <strong>Explanation:</strong>
                                 This is true.  However, what is not mentioned in the above is the number of cases of cancer that just go away without any kind of faith healing, in other words, the 
                                <i>base rate</i>
                                 of cancer remission.  It is a statistical certainty that among those with cancer, there will be a percentage with spontaneous remission.  If that percentage is the same as the faith-healing group, then that is what is to be expected, and no magic or divine healing is taking place.  The following is from the American Cancer Society:

                            <p class="uk-margin-remove uk-text-primary" style="padding-left: 20px; display: block; font-style: italic">
                                      Available scientific evidence does not support claims that faith healing can cure cancer or any other disease. Some scientists suggest that the number of people who attribute their cure to faith healing is lower than the number predicted by calculations based on the historical percentage of spontaneous remissions seen among people with cancer. However, faith healing may promote peace of mind, reduce stress, relieve pain and anxiety, and strengthen the will to live.

                                 If there are factors that increase one’s odds and alter the known statistical probabilities, it would be a reasonable assumption, as long as the variations from the statistical norm are in line with the factors that cause the variation.  In other words, perhaps the mother in our first example knows that her son is gifted musically, that counts for something, then it is not unreasonable to expect a better than 6% probability -- but assuming a 50%, 80%, or 100% probability, is still committing the fallacy.

                                 is a fallacy of statistical reasoning best demonstrated by a prosecutor when exaggerating the likelihood of a defendant's guilt. In mathematical terms, it is the claim that the probability of A given B is equal to the probability of B given A. For example,

                                    <em>The probability that you have a cervix given that you are pregnant is the same as the probability that you are pregnant given that you have a cervix.</em>

                            <p class="Body">
      Clearly, this is wrong. The probability that you have a cervix if you are pregnant is close to 100% (leaving room for weird science and magic). The probability that you are pregnant if you have a cervix is dependent on many other factors, but let’s just say it is a lot less than 100%. In legal cases, a prosecutor may abuse this fallacy to convince the jury that the chance of the defendant being innocent is very small, when it fact, if the whole population were considered (as it should be), the chance of the defendant being guilty (based on that statistic alone) is very small.

                                 Take some time in your life to read a book or take a course on probability.  Probability affects our lives in so many ways that having a good understanding of it will continually pay off.

                                It is not that clear that a fallacy is being committed, but because this is a formal argument following a strict form, even if the conclusion seems to be true, the argument is still invalid.  This is why fallacies can be very tricky and deceptive.  Since it doesn’t bark, we cannot conclude with certainty that it isn’t a dog -- it could be a dog who just can’t bark.

                            <p class="Body">
      The arguer has committed a formal fallacy, and the argument is invalid because the truth of the premises does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion.

                                The fallacy is more obvious here than in the first example. Denying the antecedent (saying that I don’t have cable) does not mean we must deny the consequent (that I have seen a naked lady...I have, by the way, in case you were wondering).

                                Remember that formal fallacies are often obscured by unstructured rants. Creating a formal argument from such rants is both an art and a science.

                                 Besides being a bit deluded, poor Frieda refuses to accept the evidence that leads to a truth she is not ready to accept.  As a result, she creates an

      Sam: Actually, it was worse in 1982 and far worse in the 1930s.  Besides, the president might only be partly responsible for the economy during his term.

                                 Out of desperation, Mark makes a claim about the president's private treatment of animals after his original claim has been refuted.

                                 Proposing possible solutions is perfectly acceptable when an argument is suggesting only a possible solution -- especially in a hypothetical situation. For example, “If there is no God, then life is meaningless.”  If there is no God who dictates meaning to our lives, perhaps we are truly free to find our own meaning.

                                 When you suspect people are just making stuff up, rather than providing evidence to support their claim, simply ask them, “What evidence do you have to support that?”
